"Cholestyramine : Concomitant cholestyramine administration decreased the mean AUC of total ezetimibe approximately 55 % . The incremental LDL - C reduction due to adding ezetimibe to cholestyramine may be reduced by this interaction . Fibrates : The safety and effectiveness of ezetimibe administered with fibrates have not been established . Fibrates may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile , leading to cholelithiasis . In a preclinical study in dogs , ezetimibe increased cholesterol in the gallbladder bile . Co - administration of ZETIA with fibrates is not recommended until use in patients is studied . Fenofibrate : In a pharmacokinetic study , concomitant fenofibrate administration increased total ezetimibe concentrations approximately 1 . 5 - fold . Gemfibrozil : In a pharmacokinetic study , concomitant gemfibrozil administration increased total ezetimibe concentrations approximately 1 . 7 - fold . HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors : No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were seen when ezetimibe was co - administered with atorvastatin , simvastatin , pravastatin , lovastatin , or fluvastatin . Cyclosporine : The total ezetimibe level increased 12 - fold in one renal transplant patient receiving multiple medications , including cyclosporine . Patients who take both ezetimibe and cyclosporine should be carefully monitored . Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility A 104 - week dietary carcinogenicity study with ezetimibe was conducted in rats at doses up to 1500 mg / kg / day ( males ) and 500 mg / kg / day ( females ) ( ~ 20 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0 - 24hr for total ezetimibe ) .

No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro in a microbial mutagenicity ( Ames ) test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli with or without metabolic activation . No evidence of clastogenicity was observed in vitro in a chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation . In addition , there was no evidence of genotoxicity in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test . In oral ( gavage ) fertility studies of ezetimibe conducted in rats , there was no evidence of reproductive toxicity at doses up to 1000 mg / kg / day in male or female rats ( ~ 7 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0 - 24hr for total ezetimibe ) . Pregnancy Pregnancy Category : C There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of ezetimibe in pregnant women . Ezetimibe should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus . In oral ( gavage ) embryo - fetal development studies of ezetimibe conducted in rats and rabbits during organogenesis , there was no evidence of embryolethal effects at the doses tested ( 250 , 500 , 1000 mg / kg / day ) . In rats , increased incidences of common fetal skeletal findings ( extra pair of thoracic ribs , unossified cervical vertebral centra , shortened ribs ) were observed at 1000 mg / kg / day ( ~ 10 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0 - 24hr for total ezetimibe ) . In rabbits treated with ezetimibe , an increased incidence of extra thoracic ribs was observed at 1000 mg / kg / day ( 150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0 - 24hr for total ezetimibe ) . Ezetimibe crossed the placenta when pregnant rats and rabbits were given multiple oral doses . Multiple dose studies of ezetimibe given in combination with HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors ( statins ) in rats and rabbits during organogenesis result in higher ezetimibe",drug
"and statin exposures . Reproductive findings occur at lower doses in combination therapy compared to monotherapy . All HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnant and nursing women . When ZETIA is administered with an HMG - CoA reductase inhibitor in a woman of childbearing potential , refer to the pregnancy category and package labeling for the HMG - CoA reductase inhibitor . Labor and Delivery The effects of ZETIA on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown . Nursing Mothers In rat studies , exposure to total ezetimibe in nursing pups was up to half of that observed in maternal plasma . It is not known whether ezetimibe is excreted into human breast milk ; therefore , ZETIA should not be used in nursing mothers unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant . Pediatric Use The pharmacokinetics of ZETIA in adolescents ( 10 to 18 years ) have been shown to be similar to that in adults . Treatment experience with ZETIA in the pediatric population is limited to 4 patients ( 9 to 17 years ) in the sitosterolemia study and 5 patients ( 11 to 17 years ) in the HoFH study . Treatment with ZETIA in children ( < 10 years ) is not recommended . Geriatric Use Of the patients who received ZETIA in clinical studies , 948 were 65 and older ( this included 206 who were 75 and older ) . The effectiveness and safety of ZETIA were similar between these patients and younger subjects . Greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .",drug
"Clinically or potentially significant drug interactions between DIFLUCAN and the following agents / classes have been observed . These are described in greater detail below : DIFLUCAN and the following agents / classes have been observed . These are described in greater detail below : Oral hypoglycemics , Coumarin - type anticoagulants , Phenytoin , Cyclosporine , Rifampin , Theophylline , Terfenadine , Cisapride , Astemizole , Rifabutin , Tacrolimus , Short - acting benzodiazepines , Oral hypoglycemics : Clinically significant hypoglycemia may be precipitated by the use of DIFLUCAN with oral hypoglycemic agents ; one fatality has been reported from hypoglycemia in association with combined DIFLUCAN and glyburide use . DIFLUCAN reduces the metabolism of tolbutamide , glyburide , and glipizide and increases the plasma concentration of these agents . When DIFLUCAN is used concomitantly with these or other sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents , blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and the dose of the sulfonylurea should be adjusted as necessary . Coumarin - type anticoagulants : Prothrombin time may be increased in patients receiving concomitant DIFLUCAN and coumarin - type anticoagulants . In post - marketing experience , as with other azole antifungals , bleeding events ( bruising , epistaxis , gastrointestinal bleeding , hematuria , and melena ) have been reported in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving fluconazole concurrently with warfarin . Careful monitoring of prothrombin time in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and coumarin - type anticoagulants is recommended .

Careful monitoring of cyclosporine concentrations and serum creatinine is recommended in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and cyclosporine . ( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Drug Interaction Studies . ) Rifampin : Rifampin enhances the metabolism of concurrently administered DIFLUCAN . Depending on clinical circumstances , consideration should be given to increasing the dose of DIFLUCAN when it is administered with rifampin . Theophylline : DIFLUCAN increases the serum concentrations of theophylline . Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and theophylline is recommended . Terfenadine : Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine , interaction studies have been performed . One study at a 200 - mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval . Another study at a 400 - mg and 800 - mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly . The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated . The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg / day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored . Cisapride : There have been reports of cardiac events , including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered . A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in",drug
"cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval . The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated . Astemizole : The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs . In the absence of definitive information , caution should be used when coadministering fluconazole . Patients should be carefully monitored . Rifabutin : There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered . Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored . Tacrolimus : There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered . Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored . Short - acting Benzodiazepines : Following oral administration of midazolam , fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects . This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously . If short - acting benzodiazepines , which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system , are concomitantly administered with fluconazole , consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage , and the patients should be appropriately monitored . Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol - and levonorgestrel - containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels ; however , in some patients there were decreases up to 47 % and 33 % of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels . The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation . While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and",drug

Infergen should be used cautiously in patients who are receiving agents that are known to cause myelosuppression or with agents known to be metabolized via the cytochrome P - 450 pathway . 9 Patients taking drugs that are metabolized by this pathway should be monitored closely for changes in the therapeutic and / or toxic levels of concomitant drugs .,drug
"Interactions for Dronabinol : In studies involving patients with AIDS and / or cancer , MARINOL ( Dronabinol ) Capsules has been co - administered with a variety of medications ( e . g . , cytotoxic agents , anti - infective agents , sedatives , or opioid analgesics ) without resulting in any clinically significant drug / drug interactions . Although no drug / drug interactions were discovered during the clinical trials of MARINOL Capsules , cannabinoids may interact with other medications through both metabolic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms . Dronabinol is highly protein bound to plasma proteins , and therefore , might displace other protein - bound drugs . Although this displacement has not been confirmed in vivo , practitioners should monitor patients for a change in dosage requirements when administering dronabinol to patients receiving other highly protein - bound drugs .",drug

"ACE inhibitors Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors . This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors . Aspirin : Concomitant administration of aspirin ( 1000 mg TID ) to healthy volunteers tended to increase the AUC ( 10 % ) and Cmax ( 24 % ) of meloxicam . The clinical significance of this interaction is not known ; however , as with other NSAIDs , concomitant administration of meloxicam and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects . Concomitant administration of low - dose aspirin with MOBIC may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications , compared to use of MOBIC alone . MOBIC is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis . Cholestyramine : Pretreatment for four days with cholestyramine significantly increased the clearance of meloxicam by 50 % . This resulted in a decrease in t1 / 2 , from 19 . 2 hours to 12 . 5 hours , and a 35 % reduction in AUC . This suggests the existence of a recirculation pathway for meloxicam in the gastrointestinal tract . The clinical relevance of this interaction has not been established . Cimetidine : Concomitant administration of 200 mg cimetidine QID did not alter the single - dose pharmacokinetics of 30 mg meloxicam . Digoxin : Meloxicam 15 mg once daily for 7 days did not alter the plasma concentration profile of digoxin after b - acetyldigoxin administration for 7 days at clinical doses . In vitro testing found no protein binding drug interaction between digoxin and meloxicam . Furosemide : Clinical studies , as well as post - marketing observations , have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics in some patients . This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis . Studies with furosemide agents and meloxicam have not demonstrated a reduction in natriuretic effect . Furosemide : single and",drug
"multiple dose pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are not affected by multiple doses of meloxicam . Nevertheless , during concomitant therapy with furosemide and MOBIC , patients should be observed closely for signs of declining renal function , as well as to assure diuretic efficacy . Lithium : In clinical trials , NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance . In a study conducted in healthy subjects , mean pre - dose lithium concentration and AUC were increased by 21 % in subjects receiving lithium doses ranging from 804 to 1072 mg BID with meloxicam 15 mg QD as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone . These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by MOBIC . Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when MOBIC is introduced or withdrawn . Methotrexate : A study in 13 rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients evaluated the effects of multiple doses of meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate taken once weekly . Meloxicam did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of methotrexate . In vitro , methotrexate did not displace meloxicam from its human serum binding sites . Warfarin : Anticoagulant activity should be monitored , particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing MOBIC therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents , since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding . The effect of meloxicam on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily doses of warfarin that produced an INR ( International Normalized Ratio ) between 1 . 2 and 1 . 8 . In these subjects , meloxicam did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics and the average anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time . However , one subject showed an increase in INR from 1 . 5 to 2 . 1 . Caution should be used when administering MOBIC with warfarin since patients on warfarin may experience changes in INR and an increased risk of bleeding complications when a new medication is",drug

Anticholinergics antagonize the effects of antiglaucoma agents . Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids . Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs , such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin ; increased serum digoxin concentrations may result . Anticholinergic drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility , such as metoclopramide . Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents , simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided .

"Dosages of concomitantly administered opioids should be reduced by approximately half , because levomepromazine amplifies the therapeutic actions and side - effects of opioids . Combination with tramadol ( Ultram ) is associated with increased risk of seizures . Additive sedative effects and confusional states may emerge if levomepromazine is given with benzodiazepines or barbiturates . This may be avoided by using the lowest dose possible with the substances in question . Exert particular caution in combining levomepromazine with other anticholinergic drugs ( tricyclic antidepressants and antiparkinsonian - agents ) : Particularly the elderly may develop delirium , high fever , severe obstipation , even ileus and glaucoma . Reduce both the dose of levomepromazine and the dose of the other drug . If possible , avoid such combinations . Caffeine and / or stimulantes of the ephedrine / amphetamine type may counteract the specific actions of levomepromazine . Concomitant use of these substances should be avoided .

When methyldopa and lithium are given concomitantly the patient should be carefully monitored for symptoms of lithium toxicity . Read the circular for lithium preparations . Several studies demonstrate a decrease in the bioavailability of methyldopa when it is ingested with ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate . This may adversely affect blood pressure control in patients treated with methyldopa . Coadministration of methyldopa with ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate is not recommended . Monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors : See CONTRAINDICATIONS . Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions Methyldopa may interfere with measurement of : urinary uric acid by the phosphotungstate method , serum creatinine by the alkaline picrate method , and SGOT by colorimetric methods . Interference with spectrophotometric methods for SGOT analysis has not been reported . Since methyldopa causes fluorescence in urine samples at the same wave lengths as catecholamines , falsely high levels of urinary catecholamines may be reported . This will interfere with the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma . It is important to recognize this phenomenon before a patient with a possible pheochromocytoma is subjected to surgery . Methyldopa does not interfere with measurement of VMA ( vanillylmandelic acid ) , a test for pheochromocytoma , by those methods which convert VMA to vanillin .

Although there have been no reports of such interactions with methylergonovine alone , potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors should not be coadministered with methylergonovine . Examples of some of the more potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors include macrolide antibiotics ( e . g . , erythromycin , troleandomycin , clarithromycin ) , HIV protease or reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( e . g . , ritonavir , indinavir , nelfinavir , delavirdine ) or azole antifungals ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole , voriconazole ) .

"The pharmacokinetic interactions listed below are potentially clinically important . Mutual inhibition of metabolism occurs with concurrent use of cyclosporin and methylprednisolone ; therefore , it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur . convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin . Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital , phenytoin , and rifampin may increase the clearance of methylprednisolone and may require increased in methylprednisolone dose to achieve the desired response . Drugs such as troleandomycin and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of methylprednisolone and thus decrease its clearance . Therefore , the dose of methylprednisolone should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity . Methylprednisolone may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspirin . This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when methylprednisolone is withdrawn . Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia . The effect of methylprednisolone on oral anticoagulants is variable . There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulant when given concurrently with corticosteroids . Therefore , coagulation indices should be monitored to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect .",drug

"The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility are antagonized by anticholinergic drugs and narcotic analgesics . Additive sedative effects can occur when metoclopramide is given with alcohol , sedatives , hypnotics , narcotics , or tranquilizers . The finding that metoclopramide releases catecholamines in patients with essential hypertension suggests that it should be used cautiously , if at all , in patients receiving monoamine oxi - dase inhibitors . Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished ( e . g . , digoxin ) by metoclopramide , whereas the rate and / or extent of absorption of drugs from the small bowel may be increased ( e . g . , acetaminophen , tetracycline , levodopa , ethanol , cyclosporine ) . Gastroparesis ( gastric stasis ) may be responsible for poor diabetic control in some patients . Exogenously administered insulin may begin to act before food has left the stomach and lead to hypoglycemia . Because the action of metoclopramide will influence the delivery of food to the intestines and thus the rate of absorption , insulin dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment .",drug
"Diuretics : Furosemide and probably other loop diuretics given concomitantly with metolazone can cause unusually large or prolonged losses of fluid and electrolytes . Other Antihypertensives : When MYKROX Tablets are used with other antihypertensive drugs , care must be taken , especially during initial therapy . Dosage adjustments of other antihypertensives may be necessary . Alcohol , Barbiturates , and Narcotics : The hypotensive effects of these drugs may be potentiated by the volume contraction that may be associated with metolazone therapy . Digitalis Glycosides : Diuretic - induced hypokalemia can increase the sensitivity of the myocardium to digitalis . Serious arrhythmias can result . Corticosteroids or ACTH : May increase the risk of hypokalemia and increase salt and water retention . Lithium : Serum lithium levels may increase . Curariform Drugs : Diuretic - induced hypokalemia may enhance neuromuscular blocking effects of curariform drugs ( such as tubocurarine ) the most serious effect would be respiratory depression which could proceed to apnea . Accordingly , it may be advisable to discontinue MYKROX Tablets three days before elective surgery . Salicylates and Other Non - Steroidal Anti - Inflammatory Drugs : May decrease the antihypertensive effects of MYKROX Tablets . Sympathomimetics : Metolazone may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine , but this diminution is not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use . Methenamine : Efficacy may be decreased due to urinary alkalizing effect of metolazone . Anticoagulants : Metolazone , as well as other thiazide - like diuretics , may affect the hypoprothrombinemic response to anticoagulants ; dosage adjustments may be necessary .",drug
"Catecholamine - depleting drugs ( e . g . , reserpine ) may have an additive effect when given with beta - blocking agents . Patients treated with extended release metoprolol succinate plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia , which may produce vertigo , syncope , or postural hypotension .",drug
"Oral metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of coumarin and warfarin , resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time . Drug interactions should be kept in mind when METROGEL ( metronidazole gel ) , 1 % is prescribed for patients who are receiving anticoagulant treatment , although they are less likely to occur with topical metronidazole administration because of low absorption .",drug
"Drugs affecting pituitary or adrenocortical function , including all corticosteroid therapy , must be discontinued prior to and during testing with Metopirone . The metabolism of Metopirone is accelerated by phenytoin ; therefore , results of the test may be inaccurate in patients taking phenytoin within two weeks before . Asubnormal response may occur in patients on estrogen therapy . Metopirone inhibits the glucuronidation of acetaminophen and could possibly potentiate acetaminophen toxicity .",drug
Caution should be observed in administering DEMSER to patients receiving phenothiazines or haloperidol because the extrapyramidal effects of these drugs can be expected to be potentiated by inhibition of catecholamine synthesis . Concurrent use of DEMSER with alcohol or other CNS depressants can increase their sedative effects .,drug
"Since MEXITIL is a substrate for the metabolic pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 enzymes , inhibition or induction of either of these enzymes would be expected to alter mexiletine plasma concentrations . In a formal , single - dose interaction study ( n = 6 males ) the clearance of mexiletine was decreased by 38 % following the coadministration of fluvoxamine , an inhibitor of CYP1A2 . In another formal study ( n = 8 extensive and n = 7 poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 ) , coadministration of propafenone did not alter the kinetics of mexiletine in the poor CYP2D6 metabolizer group . However , the metabolic clearance of mexiletine in the extensive metabolizer phenotype decreased by about 70 % making the poor and extensive metabolizer groups indistinguishable . In this crossover steady state study , the pharmacokinetics of propafenone were unaffected in either phenotype by the coadministration of mexiletine . Addition of mexiletine to propafenone did not lead to further electrocardiographic parameters changes of QRS , QTc , RR , and PR intervals than propafenone alone . When concomitant administration of either of these two drugs with mexiletine is initiated , the dose of mexiletine should be slowly titrated to desired effect . In a large compassionate use program Mexitil has been used concurrently with commonly employed antianginal , antihypertensive , and anticoagulant drugs without observed interactions . A variety of antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propranolol were also added , sometimes with improved control of ventricular ectopy . When phenytoin or other hepatic enzyme inducers such as rifampin and phenobarbital have been taken concurrently with Mexitil , lowered Mexitil plasma levels have been reported . Monitoring of Mexitil plasma levels is recommended during such concurrent use to avoid ineffective therapy . In a formal study , benzodiazepines were shown not to affect Mexitil plasma concentrations . ECG intervals ( PR , QRS , and QT ) were not affected by concurrent Mexitil and digoxin , diuretics , or",drug
"propranolol . Concurrent administration of cimetidine and Mexitil has been reported to increase , decrease , or leave unchanged Mexitil plasma levels ; therefore patients should be followed carefully during concurrent therapy . Mexitil does not alter serum digoxin levels but magnesium - aluminum hydroxide , when used to treat gastrointestinal symptoms due to Mexitil , has been reported to lower serum digoxin levels . Concurrent use of Mexitil and theophylline may lead to increased plasma theophylline levels . One controlled study in eight normal subjects showed a 72 % mean increase ( range 35 - 136 % ) in plasma theophylline levels . This increase was observed at the first test point which was the second day after starting Mexitil . Theophylline plasma levels returned to pre - Mexitil values within 48 hours after discontinuing Mexitil . If Mexitil and theophylline are to be used concurrently , theophylline blood levels should be monitored , particularly when the Mexitil dose is changed . An appropriate adjustment in theophylline dose should be considered . Additionally , in one controlled study in five normal subjects and seven patients , the clearance of caffeine was decreased 50 % following the administration of Mexitil .",drug

In these studies , no interaction that altered the pharmacokinetics of micafungin was observed . There was no effect of a single dose or multiple doses of MYCAMINE on mycophenolate mofetil , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , prednisolone , and fluconazole pharmacokinetics . Sirolimus AUC was increased by 21 % with no effect on Cmax in the presence of steady - state MYCAMINE compared with sirolimus alone . Nifedipine AUC and Cmax were increased by 18 % and 42 % , respectively , in the presence of steady - state MYCAMINE compared with nifedipine alone . Patients receiving sirolimus or nifedipine in combination with MYCAMINE should be monitored for sirolimus or nifedipine toxicity and sirolimus or nifedipine dosage should be reduced if necessary . Micafungin is not an inhibitor of P - glycoprotein and , therefore , would not be expected to alter P - glycoprotein - mediated drug transport activity .",drug
"Drug Interactions : Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Isozymes : Caution is advised when midazolam is administered concomitantly with drugs that are known to inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system ( ie , some drugs in the drug classes of azole antimycotics , protease inhibitors , calcium channel antagonists , and macrolide antibiotics ) . Drugs such as erythromycin , diltiazem , verapamil , ketoconazole , fluconazole and itraconazole were shown to significantly increase the C max and AUC of orally administered midazolam . These drug interactions may result in increased and prolonged sedation due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam . Although not studied , the potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors ritonavir and nelfinavir may cause intense and prolonged sedation and respiratory depression due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam . Caution is advised when VERSED Syrup is used concomitantly with these drugs . Dose adjustments should be considered and possible prolongation and intensity of effect should be anticipated . Inducers of CYP3A4 Isozymes : Cytochrome P450 inducers , such as rifampin , carbamazepine , and phenytoin , induce metabolism and caused a markedly decreased C max and AUC of oral midazolam in adult studies . Although clinical studies have not been performed , phenobarbital is expected to have the same effect . Caution is advised when administering VERSED Syrup to patients receiving these medications and if necessary dose adjustments should be considered . The difficulty in achieving adequate sedation may have been the result of decreased absorption of the sedatives due to both the gastrointestinal effects and stimulant effects of methylphenidate . The sedative effect of VERSED Syrup is accentuated by any concomitantly administered medication which depresses the central nervous system , particularly narcotics ( eg , morphine , meperidine and fentanyl ) , propofol , ketamine , nitrous oxide , secobarbital and droperidol . Consequently",drug
", the dose of VERSED Syrup should be adjusted according to the type and amount of concomitant medications administered and the desired clinical response . No significant adverse interactions with common premedications ( such as atropine , scopolamine , glycopyrrolate , diazepam , hydroxyzine , and other muscle relaxants ) or local anesthetics have been observed .",drug
"When administered concomitantly with ProAmatine , cardiac glycosides may enhance or precipitate bradycardia , A . V . block or arrhythmia . The use of drugs that stimulate alpha - adrenergic receptors ( e . g . , phenylephrine , pseudoephedrine , ephedrine , phenylpropanolamine or dihydroergotamine ) may enhance or potentiate the pressor effects of ProAmatine . Therefore , caution should be used when ProAmatine is administered concomitantly with agents that cause vasoconstriction . ProAmatine has been used in patients concomitantly treated with salt - retaining steroid therapy ( i . e . , fludrocortisone acetate ) , with or without salt supplementation . The potential for supine hypertension should be carefully monitored in these patients and may be minimized by either reducing the dose of fludrocortisone acetate or decreasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with . ProAmatine . Alpha - adrenergic blocking agents , such as prazosin , terazosin , and doxazosin , can antagonize the effects of ProAmatine . Potential for Drug Interactions : It appears possible , although there is no supporting experimental evidence , that the high renal clearance of desglymidodrine ( a base ) is due to active tubular secretion by the base - secreting system also responsible for the secretion of such drugs as metformin , cimetidine , ranitidine , procainamide , triamterene , flecainide , and quinidine . Thus there may be a potential for drug - drug interactions with these drugs .",drug
"Although specific drug or food interactions with mifepristone have not been studied , on the basis of this drug s metabolism by CYP 3A4 , it is possible that ketoconazole , itraconazole , erythromycin , and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism ( increasing serum levels of mifepristone ) . Furthermore , rifampin , dexamethasone , St . John s Wort , and certain anticonvulsants ( phenytoin , phenobarbital , carbamazepine ) may induce mifepristone metabolism ( lowering serum levels of mifepristone ) . Based on in vitro inhibition information , coadministration of mifepristone may lead to an increase in serum levels of drugs that are CYP 3A4 substrates . Due to the slow elimination of mifepristone from the body , such interaction may be observed for a prolonged period after its administration . Therefore , caution should be exercised when mifepristone is administered with drugs that are CYP 3A4 substrates and have narrow therapeutic range , including some agents used during general anesthesia .",drug
"While co - administration of ZAVESCA appeared to increase the clearance of Cerezyme by 70 % , these results are not conclusive because of the small number of subjects studied and because patients took variable doses of Cerezyme .

"Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity , patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage . Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin , it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline class drugs in conjunction with penicillin . Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum , calcium or magnesium , and iron - containing preparations .

"As with other drugs , the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms ( e . g . , pharmacodynamic , pharmacokinetic inhibition or enhancement , etc . ) is a possibility . Drugs Affecting Hepatic Metabolism The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of REMERON SolTab ( mirtazapine ) Orally Disintegrating Tablets may be affected by the induction or inhibition of drug - metab - olizing enzymes . Drugs that are Metabolized by and / or Inhibit Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Many drugs are metabolized by and / or inhibit various cytochrome P450 enzymes , e . g . , 2D6 , 1A2 , 3A4 , etc . In vitro studies have shown that mirtazapine is a substrate for several of these enzymes , including 2D6 , 1A2 , and 3A4 . While in vitro studies have shown that mirtazapine is not a potent inhibitor of any of these enzymes , an indication that mirtazapine is not likely to have a clinically significant inhibitory effect on the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates for these cytochrome P450 enzymes , the concomitant use of REMERON SolTab with most other drugs metabolized by these enzymes has not been formally studied . Consequently , it is not possible to make any definitive statements about the risks of coadministration of REMERON SolTab with such drugs . Alcohol : Concomitant administration of alcohol ( equivalent to 60 g ) had a minimal effect on plasma levels of mirtazapine ( 15 mg ) in 6 healthy male subjects . However , the impairment of cognitive and motor skills produced by REMERON were shown to be additive with those produced by alcohol . Accordingly , patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking REMERON SolTab . Diazepam : Concomitant administration of diazepam ( 15 mg ) had a minimal effect on plasma levels of mirtazapine ( 15 mg ) in 12 healthy subjects . However , the impairment of motor skills produced by REMERON has been shown to be additive with those caused by diazepam .

"Although MIVACRON ( a mixture of three stereoisomers ) has been administered safely following succinylcholine - facilitated tracheal intubation , the interaction between MIVACRON and succinylcholine has not been systematically studied . Prior administration of succinylcholine can potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effects of nondepolarizing agents . Evidence of spontaneous recovery from succinylcholine should be observed before the administration of MIVACRON . The use of MIVACRON before succinylcholine to attenuate some of the side effects of succinylcholine has not been studied . There are no clinical data on the use of MIVACRON with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents . Isoflurane and enflurane ( administered with nitrous oxide / oxygen to achieve 1 . 25 M . C . decrease the ED50 of MIVACRON by as much as 25 % ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacodynamics and Individualization of Dosages ) . These agents may also prolong the clinically effective duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement of MIVACRON by as much as 35 % to 40 % . A greater potentiation of the neuromuscular blocking effects of MIVACRON may be expected with higher concentrations of enflurane or isoflurane . Halothane has little or no effect on the ED50 , but may prolong the duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement by as much as 20 % . Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as MIVACRON include certain antibiotics ( e . g . , aminoglycosides , tetracyclines , bacitracin , polymyxins , lincomycin , clindamycin , colistin , and sodium colistimethate ) , magnesium salts , lithium , local anesthetics , procainamide , and quinidine . The neuromuscular blocking effect of MIVACRON may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity ( e . g . , chronically administered oral contraceptives , glucocorticoids , or certain monoamine",drug

"Diuretics : Excessive reductions in blood pressure may occur in patients on diuretic therapy when ACE inhibitors are started . The possibility of hypotensive effects with UNIVASC can be minimized by discontinuing diuretic therapy for several days or cautiously increasing salt intake before initiation of treatment with UNIVASC . If this is not possible , the starting dose of moexpril should be reduced . . Potassium Supplements and Potassium - Sparing Diuretics : UNIVASC can increase serum potassium because it decreases aldosterone secretion . Use of potassium - sparing diuretics ( spironolactone , triamterene , amiloride ) or potassium supplements concomitantly with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia . Therefore , if concomitant use of such agents is indicated , they should be given with caution and the patient ' s serum potassium should be monitored . Oral Anticoagulants : Interaction studies with warfarin failed to identify any clinically important effect on the serum concentrations of the anticoagulant or on its anticoagulant effect . Lithium : Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium . These drugs should be coadministered with caution , and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended . If a diuretic is also used , the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased .

"Antacids : Absorption of a single dose of Myfortic was decreased when administered to 12 stable renal transplant patients also taking magnesium - aluminum containing antacids ( 30 mL ) : the mean Cmax and AUC ( 0 - t ) values for MPA were 25 % and 37 % lower , respectively , than when Myfortic was administered alone under fasting conditions . It is recommended that Myfortic and antacids not be administered simultaneously . Cyclosporine : When studied in stable renal transplant patients , cyclosporine , USP ( MODIFIED ) pharmacokinetics were unaffected by steady state dosing of Myfortic . Acyclovir / Ganciclovir : may be taken with Myfortic ; however , during the period of treatment , physicians should monitor blood cell counts . Both acyclovir / ganciclovir and MPAG concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment , their coexistence may compete for tubular secretion and further increase in the concentrations of the two . Azathioprine / Mycophenolate Mofetil : Given that azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil inhibit purine metabolism , it is recommended that Myfortic not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil . Cholestyramine and Drugs that Bind Bile Acids : These drugs interrupt enterohepatic recirculation and reduce MPA exposure when coadministered with mycophenolate mofetil . Therefore , do not administer Myfortic with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation or drugs that may bind bile acids , for example bile acid sequestrates or oral activated charcoal , because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of Myfortic .

Although undercarboxylated osteocalcin , a marker of vitamin K nutritional status , was unaltered with XENICAL administration , vitamin K levels tended to decline in subjects taking XENICAL . Therefore , as vitamin K absorption may be decreased with XENICAL , patients on chronic stable doses of warfarin who are prescribed XENICAL should be monitored closely for changes in coagulation parameters .",drug

"Anticoagulants Anabolic steroids may increase sensitivity to oral anticoagulants . Dosage of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased in order to maintain desired prothrombin time . Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy require close monitoring , especially when anabolic steroids are started or stopped . Warfarin : A multidose study of oxandrolone , given as 5 or 10 mg BID in 15 healthy subjects concurrently treated with warfarin , resulted in a mean increase in S - warfarin half - life from 26 to 48 hours and AUC from 4 . 55 to 12 . 08 ng * hr / mL : similar increases in R - warfarin half - life and AUC were also detected . Microscopic hematuria ( 9 / 15 ) and gingival bleeding ( 1 / 15 ) were also observed . A 5 . 5 - fold decrease in the mean warfarin dose from 6 . 13 mg / day to 1 . 13 mg / day ( approximately 80 - 85 % reduction of warfarin dose ) , was necessary to maintain a target INR of 1 . 5 . When oxandrolone therapy is initiated in a patient already receiving treatment with warfarin , the INR or prothrombin time ( PT ) should be monitored closely and the dose of warfarin adjusted as necessary until a stable target INR or PT has been achieved . Furthermore , in patients receiving both drugs , careful monitoring of the INR or PT , and adjustment of the warfarin dosage if indicated are recommended when the oxandrolone dose is changed or discontinued . Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of occult bleeding . Oral hypoglycemic agents Oxandrolone may inhibit the metabolism of oral hypoglycemic agents . Adrenal steroids or ACTH In patients with edema , concomitant administration with adrenal cortical steroids or ACTH may increase the edema .

"The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth , constipation , somnolence ( drowsiness ) , and / or other anticholinergic - like effects may increase the frequency and / or severity of such effects . Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility . This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index . Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when DITROPAN XL was administered with ketoconazole , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor . Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system , such as antimycotic agents ( e . g . , itraconazole and miconazole ) or macrolide antibiotics ( e . g . , erythromycin and clarithromycin ) , may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters ( i . e . , Cmax and AUC ) . The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known . Caution should be used when such drugs are co - administered .

"Potential for INVEGA to Affect Other Drugs Paliperidone is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes . In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that paliperidone does not substantially inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes , including CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2C8 / 9 / 10 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , CYP3A4 , and CYP3A5 . Therefore , paliperidone is not expected to inhibit clearance of drugs that are metabolized by these metabolic pathways in a clinically relevant manner . Paliperidone is also not expected to have enzyme inducing properties . At therapeutic concentrations , paliperidone did not inhibit P - glycoprotein . Paliperidone is therefore not expected to inhibit P - glycoprotein - mediated transport of other drugs in a clinically relevant manner . Given the primary CNS effects of paliperidone , INVEGA should be used with caution in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol . Paliperidone may antagonize the effect of levodopa and other dopamine agonists . Because of its potential for inducing orthostatic hypotension , an additive effect may be observed when INVEGA is administered with other therapeutic agents that have this potential . Potential for Other Drugs to Affect INVEGA Paliperidone is not a substrate of CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 , so that an interaction with inhibitors or inducers of these isozymes is unlikely . While in vitro studies indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may be minimally involved in paliperidone metabolism , in vivo studies do not show decreased elimination by these isozymes and they contribute to only a small fraction of total body clearance .",drug

"Palonosetron is eliminated from the body through both renal excretion and metabolic pathways with the latter mediated via multiple CYP enzymes . In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 / 5 ( CYP2C19 was not investigated ) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2 , CYP2D6 , or CYP3A4 / 5 . Therefore , the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low . A study in healthy volunteers involving single - dose IV palonosetron ( 0 . 75 mg ) and steady state oral metoclopramide ( 10 mg four times daily ) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction . In controlled clinical trials , ALOXI injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids , analgesics , antiemetics / antinauseants , antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents .

Clinically relevant interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs with the same metabolic pathways are not expected . Therefore , when coadministered with pantoprazole , adjustment of the dosage of pantoprazole or of such drugs may not be necessary . There was also no interaction with concomitantly administered antacids . There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors , including pantoprazole , and warfarin concomitantly . Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death . Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time . Because of profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion , pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability ( eg , ketoconazole , ampicillin esters , and iron salts ) .

If diuretics cannot be interrupted , close medical supervision should be provided with the first dose of ACEON Tablets , for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour . The rate and extent of perindopril absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant diuretics . The bioavailability of perindoprilat was reduced by diuretics , however , and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition . Potassium Supplements and Potassium - Sparing Diuretics : ACEON Tablets may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production . Use of potassium - sparing diuretics ( spironolactone , amiloride , triamterene and others ) , potassium supplements or other drugs capable of increasing serum potassium ( indomethacin , heparin , cyclosporine and others ) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia .

"Ropivacaine should be used with caution in patients receiving other local anesthetics or agents structurally related to amide - type local anesthetics , since the toxic effects of these drugs are additive . Cytochrome P4501A2 is involved in the formation of 3 - hydroxy ropivacaine , the major metabolite . In vivo , the plasma clearance of ropivacaine was reduced by 70 % during coadministration of fluvoxamine ( 25 mg bid for 2 days ) , a selective and potent CYP1A2 inhibitor . Thus strong inhibitors of cytochrome P4501A2 , such as fluvoxamine , given concomitantly during administration of Ropivacaine , can interact with Ropivacaine leading to increased ropivacaine plasma levels .

"In a study in which 34 different drugs were tested , therapeutically relevant concentrations of tolbutamide , sodium salicylate and sulfamethizole displaced protein - bound teniposide in fresh human serum to a small but significant extent . Because of the extremely high binding of teniposide to plasma proteins , these small decreases in binding could cause substantial increases in free drug levels in plasma which could result in potentiation of drug toxicity . Therefore , caution should be used in administering VUMON ( teniposide injection ) to patients receiving these other agents . There was no change in the plasma kinetics of teniposide when coadministered with methotrexate . However , the plasma clearance of methotrexate was slightly increased . An increase in intracellular levels of methotrexate was observed in vitro in the presence of teniposide .",drug

"Single - dose bioequivalence of 105 - mg fenofibric acid tablets versus 145 - mg fenofibrate tablets under fasting and fed conditions : a report of two phase I , open - label , single - dose , randomized , crossover clinical trials . Fenofibrate is used to treat primary hypercholesterolemia , mixed lipidemia , and hypertriglyceridemia in adults who do not respond to nonpharmacologic measures . Fenofibrate is a prodrug that is rapidly and completely hydrolyzed to fenofibric acid , the active moiety . A new orally administered agent , fenofibric acid , was developed as an alternative to fenofibrate . Two separate studies were conducted to evaluate the bioequivalence of fenofibric acid relative to fenofibrate under fasted and fed ( standard breakfast ) conditions , characterize the pharmacokinetic profile , and assess the safety and tolerability of fenofibric acid . In study 1 ( fasted ) , during each study period , volunteers received a single 105 - mg dose of fenofibric acid or single 145 - mg dose of fenofibrate ( depending on their randomization scheme ) after an overnight fast ( a minimum fast of 10 hours ) .

Here , we examined its effects on multiple myeloma ( MM ) cells and found that , at 500 nM , it potently inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in 2 of 8 MM cell lines . RNA from un - treated and DZNep treated cells was profiled by Affymetrix HG - U133 Plus 2 . 0 microarray and genes with a significant change in gene expression were determined by significance analysis of microarray ( SAM ) testing . ALOX5 was the most down - regulated gene ( 5 . 8 - fold ) in sensitive cells and was expressed at low level in resistant cells . The results were corroborated by quantitative RT - PCR . Western - blot analysis indicated ALOX5 was highly expressed only in sensitive cell line H929 and greatly decreased upon DZNep treatment . Ectopic expression of ALOX5 reduced sensitivity to DZNep in H929 cells . Furthermore , down - regulation of ALOX5 by RNA interference could also induce apoptosis in H929 . Gene expression analysis on MM patient dataset indicated ALOX5 expression was significantly higher in MM patients compared to normal plasma cells . We also found that Bcl - 2 was overexpressed in DZNep insensitive cells , and cotreatment with DZNep and ABT - 737 , a Bcl - 2 family inhibitor , synergistically inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of DZNep insensitive MM cells . Taken together , this study shows one of mechanisms of the DZNep efficacy on MM correlates with its ability to down - regulate the ALOX5 levels . In addition , DZNep insensitivity might be associated with overexpression of Bcl - 2 , and the combination of ABT - 737 and DZNep could synergistically induced apoptosis . These results suggest that DZNep may be exploited therapeutically",drug

"Flow cytometry - based pharmacodynamic monitoring after organ transplantation . Conventional therapeutic drug monitoring based on measuring immunosupressive drug concentrations in blood is important in the clinical management of immunosuppressive therapy in transplantation medicine . Since rejection or infection occurs at irregular drug concentrations immunosuppressive drug therapy is often empiric and prophylactic in nature . In addition , blood immunosuppressant levels are only indirect predictors of the pharmacologic effects on immune cells , because the genetic heterogeneity the immune systems of transplant recipients are not equally sensitive to drug effects . Therefore , therapeutic drug monitoring requires the application of reliable and effective methods to study the pharmacodynamic variability by direct measurements of drug effects on immune cell functions . Flow cytometry offers a multiplicity of quantitative analysis possibilities , from detection of phosphorylated molecules up to complex multicolor analysis of whole blood samples . A large spectrum of flow cytometry - based applications for pharmacodynamic monitoring is available and allows detection and analysis of diverse function of T cells and dendritic cell subsets . By combining several assays , it is possible to generate a broad picture of the immune status of every single transplanted recipient . Furthermore , it is even possible to differentiate between synergistic and antagonistic pharmacodynamic effects of immunosuppressive drug combination therapy in vitro and to predict the pharmacodynamic drug effects in transplanted recipients . Such a pharmacodynamic drug monitoring may offer the opportunity to complete conventional therapeutic drug monitoring and , therefore , to tailor immunosuppressive therapy more individually .",drug
"[ Tuberculosis and HIV - features of the co - infection ] . The human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) epidemic has allowed the incidence of tuberculosis to rise globally and particularly in sub - Saharan Africa . Diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis is more complex in patients with HIV / AIDS . Sputum smear microscopy is performing poorly in HIV - infected individuals , who are often started on antituberculosis treatment on clinical grounds . The treatment of coinfected patients requires antituberculosis and antiretroviral drugs to be administered concomittantly ; challenges include pill burden and patient compliance , drug interactions , overlapping toxic effects , and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome . Current guidelines recommend starting antiretroviral treatment within a few weeks of antituberculosis therapy for patients with CD4 cell counts 350 cells / ul .",drug

"Effects of neferine on the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone in rats . Amiodarone , an iodinated benzofuran derivative with predominantly class III anti - arrhythmic effects , is used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias . The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of neferine , an effective anti - pulmonary fibrosis drug isolated from the embryo of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertner ' s seeds , to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of amiodarone . Experimental Sprague - Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups . In groups 1 and 2 , amiodarone was given to rats by intragastric and intravenous administration , respectively , while neferine was co - administratered by intragastric administration . Blood samples were collected from the orbital venous plexus at indicated time points and were analyzed for amiodarone concentration using RP - HPLC . The geometric mean ratio for C ( max ) and AUC ( 0 - 96 ) was calculated . There were no significant differences between the pharmacokinetics parameters of amiodarone administered intravenously or intragastrically and the control ( without neferine ) group ( with ratios of 0 . 7 - 1 . 4 in all experimental groups ) , suggesting that neferine had no effect on amiodarone plasma pharmacokinetics . The dosage regimen of amiodarone does not need to be taken into consideration when combined with neferine .",drug

"Structural basis for alcohol modulation of a pentameric ligand - gated ion channel . Despite its long history of use and abuse in human culture , the molecular basis for alcohol action in the brain is poorly understood . The recent determination of the atomic - scale structure of GLIC , a prokaryotic member of the pentameric ligand - gated ion channel ( pLGIC ) family , provides a unique opportunity to characterize the structural basis for modulation of these channels , many of which are alcohol targets in brain . We observed that GLIC recapitulates bimodal modulation by n - alcohols , similar to some eukaryotic pLGICs : methanol and ethanol weakly potentiated proton - activated currents in GLIC , whereas n - alcohols larger than ethanol inhibited them . Mapping of residues important to alcohol modulation of ionotropic receptors for glycine , - aminobutyric acid , and acetylcholine onto GLIC revealed their proximity to transmembrane cavities that may accommodate one or more alcohol molecules . Site - directed mutations in the pore - lining M2 helix allowed the identification of four residues that influence alcohol potentiation , with the direction of their effects reflecting - helical structure . At one of the potentiation - enhancing residues , decreased side chain volume converted GLIC into a highly ethanol - sensitive channel , comparable to its eukaryotic relatives . Covalent labeling of M2 positions with an alcohol analog , a methanethiosulfonate reagent , further implicated residues at the extracellular end of the helix in alcohol binding . Molecular dynamics simulations elucidated the structural consequences of a potentiation - enhancing mutation and suggested a structural mechanism for alcohol potentiation via interaction with a transmembrane cavity previously termed the "" linking tunnel . "" These results provide a unique structural model for independent potentiating and inhibitory interactions of n - alcohols with a pLGIC family member .",drug
"Neuropharmacological approach against MPTP ( 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridine ) - induced mouse model of Parkinson ' s disease . Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) is a common neurodegenerative disease that appears essentially as a sporadic condition . PD is well known to be a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease produced by a selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta . The main clinical features of PD include tremor , bradykinesia , rigidity and postural instability . Most insights into pathogenesis of PD come from investigations performed in experimental models of PD , especially those produced by neurotoxins . The biochemical and cellular alterations that occur after 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridine ( MPTP ) treatment are remarkably similar to that observed in idiopathic PD . Furthermore , it is well known that acute treatment with MPTP can cause a severe loss of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter protein levels and dopamine contents in the striatum of mice , as compared to continuous MPTP treatment . Thus these findings may support the validity of acute MPTP treatment model for unraveling in the neurodegenerative processes in PD . In this review , we discuss the neuroprotective effects of various compounds against neuronal cell loss in an MPTP model of PD . This review may lead to a much better understanding of PD as well as provide novel clues to new targets for therapeutic interventions in PD patients .",drug
"Antidepressant - warfarin interaction and associated gastrointestinal bleeding risk in a case - control study . Bleeding is the most common and worrisome adverse effect of warfarin therapy . One of the factors that might increase bleeding risk is initiation of interacting drugs that potentiate warfarin . We sought to evaluate whether initiation of an antidepressant increases the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding in warfarin users . Medicaid claims data ( 1999 - 2005 ) were used to perform an observational case - control study nested within person - time exposed to warfarin in those 18 years . In total , 430 , 455 warfarin users contributed 407 , 370 person - years of warfarin use . The incidence rate of hospitalization for GI bleeding among warfarin users was 4 . 48 per 100 person - years ( 95 % CI , 4 . 42 - 4 . 55 ) . Each gastrointestinal bleeding cases was matched to 50 controls based on index date and state . Warfarin users had an increased odds ratio of gastrointestinal bleeding upon initiation of citalopram ( OR = 1 . 73 [ 95 % CI , 1 . 25 - 2 . 38 ] ) , fluoxetine ( OR = 1 . 63 [ 95 % CI , 1 . 11 - 2 . 38 ] ) , paroxetine ( OR = 1 . 64 [ 95 % CI , 1 . 27 - 2 . 12 ] ) , amitriptyline ( OR = 1 . 47 [ 95 % CI , 1 . 02 - 2 . 11 ] ) . Also mirtazapine , which is not believed to interact with warfarin , increased the risk of GI bleeding ( OR = 1 . 75 [ 95 % CI , 1 . 30 - 2 . 35 ] ) . Warfarin users who initiated citalopram , fluoxetine , paroxetine , amitriptyline , or mirtazapine had an increased risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding . However , the elevated risk with mirtazapine suggests that a drug - drug interaction may not have been responsible for all of the observed increased risk .",drug
"Mechanisms of drug toxicity or intolerance . Classically , adverse drug reactions had been considered as type A reactions which are related to the main pharmacological action of the drug and therefore are predictable . Such reactions are predictable , reversible , and usually can be managed by lowering the dose of the offending drug . However , other adverse effects of drugs can occur which are unrelated to the main pharmacological action of the drug - type B reactions . Such adverse effects are termed idiosyncratic and are often initiated by metabolites of the parent drug or by other indirect mechanisms . The detailed understanding of adverse drug events has become a major focus of the regulatory agencies throughout the world . The pharmacotherapy of gastrointestinal and liver disorders is becoming increasingly complex . In recent years , with the advent of novel therapeutic agents to treat a host of disorders , including viral hepatitis , gastrointestinal motility disorders , inflammatory bowel disease and others , the potential for serious clinically relevant drug reactions has increased . In the pharmacotherapy of gastrointestinal and liver diseases , a significant number of adverse events that occur can be explained by drug interactions . Some pharmacokinetic drug interactions are based on the competitive inhibition of the rate of drug metabolism of one of the drugs , leading to an increased concentration of the drug which was not intended . In other examples , the interaction can be mechanistic in which one or more drugs when co - administered potentiate each other ' s actions without any change in drug levels , termed pharmacodynamic interactions .",drug
"Unrecognized fatalities related to colchicine in hospitalized patients . Colchicine is commonly used for the treatment of gout and occasionally for other inflammatory diseases . It has a narrow therapeutic index and the potential for severe or fatal toxicity . We sought to determine ( 1 ) the frequency of colchicine toxicity among hospitalized patients taking colchicine who died during an admission , ( 2 ) the likelihood that colchicine contributed to death , ( 3 ) whether patients were taking interacting medications that could have contributed to toxicity , and ( 4 ) whether colchicine dosing among these patients adhered to established guidelines . We conducted an IRB - approved , retrospective chart review at an urban , tertiary care , 1228 - bed , university hospital . Subjects included hospitalized patients who received colchicine and died in hospital between 1 January 2000 and 28 February 2007 . We reviewed charts for signs and symptoms of colchicine toxicity . An expert panel reviewed each case and classified the likelihood of colchicine toxicity , the likelihood of a causal role of colchicine in the death using the WHO classification system , and the appropriateness of colchicine dosing . Thirty - seven hospitalized patients who died during the 86 - month study period received colchicine . Toxicity was unlikely in 20 / 37 , possible in 8 / 37 , likely in 5 / 37 , and certain in 4 / 37 . A contributing role for colchicine in causing death was unlikely in 24 / 37 , possible in 7 / 37 , likely in 3 / 37 , and certain in 3 / 37 . Colchicine doses ( based on creatinine clearance ) exceeded the accepted range for 12 patients , including 10 of 17 cases of toxicity and 8 of 13 cases of death classified as possible or higher . Seventeen patients received interacting medications , including 8 of 17 cases of toxicity and 8 of 13 cases of death classified as possible or higher . Colchicine toxicity was frequent in this cohort and may have contributed to about one - third of the deaths . Inappropriate dosing of colchicine occurred frequently and was related to toxicity and death .",drug
"Effects of CYP inhibitors on precocene I metabolism and toxicity in rat liver slices . We present a comprehensive in vitro approach to assessing metabolism - mediated hepatotoxicity using male Sprague - Dawley rat liver slices incubated with the well characterized hepatotoxicant , precocene I , and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes . This approach combines liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( LC MS ) detection methods with multiple toxicity endpoints to enable identification of critical metabolic pathways for hepatotoxicity . The incubations were performed in the absence and presence of the non - specific CYP inhibitor , 1 - aminobenzotriazole ( ABT ) and isoform - specific inhibitors . The metabolite profile of precocene I in rat liver slices shares some features of the in vivo profile , but also had a major difference in that epoxide dihydrodiol hydrolysis products were not observed to a measurable extent . As examples of our liver slice metabolite identification procedure , a minor glutathione adduct and previously unreported 7 - O - desmethyl and glucuronidated metabolites of precocene I are reported . Precocene I induced hepatocellular necrosis in a dose - and time - dependent manner . ABT decreased the toxicity of precocene I , increased exposure to parent compound , and decreased metabolite levels in a dose - dependent manner . Of the isoform - specific CYP inhibitors tested for an effect on the precocene I metabolite profile , only tranylcypromine was noticeably effective , indicating a role of CYPs 2A6 , 2C9 , 2Cl9 , and 2E1 . With respect to toxicity , the order of CYP inhibitor effectiveness was ABT > diethyldithiocarbamate ~ tranylcypromine > ketoconazole . Furafylline and sulfaphenazole had no effect , while quinidine appeared to augment precocene I toxicity . These results suggest that rat liver slices do not reproduce the reported in vivo biotransformation of precocene I and therefore may not be an appropriate model for precocene I metabolism . However , these results provide an example",drug

Risk stratification schemes have been developed that categorize patients ' stroke risk into classes based on a combination of risk factors . According to the calculated level of risk , guidelines recommend patients with atrial fibrillation receive antithrombotic therapy either as a vitamin K antagonist or aspirin . Despite recommendations , however , many patients with atrial fibrillation do not receive adequate thromboprophylaxis . We will discuss some of the underlying reasons , in part related to the drawbacks associated with vitamin K antagonists . These highlight the need for new anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation .

"Glycosidic enzymes enhance retinal transduction following intravitreal delivery of AAV2 . To determine whether the co - injection of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes improves retinal transduction following intravitreal delivery of adeno - associated virus - 2 ( AAV2 ) . AAV2 containing cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) , under the control of a chicken - actin promoter , was delivered by intravitreal injection to adult mice in conjunction with enzymes including collagenase , hyaluronan lyase , heparinase III , or chondroitin ABC lyase . Two weeks later , retinal flatmounts were examined for GFP expression using confocal microscopy . Without the addition of enzymes , transduction was limited to occasional cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer . The addition of heparinase III or chondroitin ABC lyase greatly enhanced transduction of the retinal ganglion cell layer and increased the depth of transduction into the outer retina . Hyaluronan lyase had a limited effect and collagenase was ineffective . Electroretinograms survived with higher concentrations of heparinase III and chondroitin ABC lyase than were required for optimal retinal transduction . AAV2 - mediated retinal transduction is improved by co - injection of heparinase III or chondroitin ABC lyase . Improved transduction efficiency may allow intravitreal injection to become the preferred route for delivering gene therapy to both the inner and outer retina .",drug

EA signs were observed in all 7 patients in association with propofol TIVA but did not recur in any of 123 subsequent anesthetics sessions during which low - dose ketamine was added to propofol . Based on this experience , we suggest that low - dose ketamine added to propofol may be associated with prevention of EA in children with a history of EA with propofol TIVA .",drug
"Tamoxifen and CYP 2D6 inhibitors : caution . Tamoxifen , an estrogen antagonist , is the standard hormone treatment for breast cancer . It is extensively transformed into its active metabolites by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system , especially into endoxifen by isoenzyme CYP 2D6 . Co - administration of tamoxifen with isoenzyme CYP 2D6 inhibitors reduces this metabolism . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) antidepressants inhibit isoenzyme CYP 2D6 . Paroxetine and fluoxetine reduce the plasma concentration of endoxifen by about 50 % . Two epidemiological studies involving about 3700 women have shown a link between the use of SSRI antidepressants and an increased frequency of breast cancer recurrence . Other studies , with a lower level of evidence , were less convincing . Studies of other isoenzyme CYP 2D6 inhibitors showed no increase in the risk of breast cancer recurrence , but they lacked statistical power . It is better to avoid prescribing isoenzyme CYP 2D6 inhibitors to women treated with tamoxifen for breast cancer , especially SSRI antidepressants such as paroxetine and fluoxetine . Depression does not always require antidepressant drug therapy , and antidepressants have no proven preventive impact on hot flushes linked to the menopause . If in certain cases , an antidepressant is considered necessary , it may be advisable to replace tamoxifen with anastrozole .",drug
"Clarity and applicability of drug - drug interaction management guidelines : a systematic appraisal by general practitioners and community pharmacists in the Netherlands . Despite the availability and daily use of computerized drug - drug interaction surveillance systems , exposure to potentially relevant drug - drug interactions ( DDIs ) continues . DDI management guidelines are often inadequate and clear management options are lacking , which attributes to overriding of DDI signals . Although general criteria for the development and reporting of high - quality clinical practice guidelines have been identified , it appears these have not yet been applied to DDI management guidelines . The aim of the study was to assess the clarity and applicability of guidelines for the management of potentially harmful DDIs . We selected 13 DDIs that are potentially harmful for patients and frequently occur in community pharmacy practice in the Netherlands . The clarity and applicability of the management guidelines of these DDIs were appraised using the appropriate two domains - ' Clarity and presentation ' and ' Applicability ' , of the validated Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation ( AGREE ) Instrument . The appraisal was performed by 12 community pharmacists and 12 general practitioners . The standardized domain scores and mean item scores for ' Clarity and presentation ' and ' Applicability ' were compared . All DDI management guidelines were generally found to score well on ' Clarity and presentation ' , but poorly with respect to ' Applicability ' ( standardized domain scores 68 . 0 vs 26 . 1 % ) . Within the domain ' Clarity and presentation ' , the item ' tools for application ' received the lowest scores . Within the domain ' Applicability ' , cost implications , organizational barriers and key review criteria were all poorly documented .

"Motor deficits and recovery in rats with unilateral spinal cord hemisection mimic the Brown - Sequard syndrome . Cervical incomplete spinal cord injuries often lead to severe and persistent impairments of sensorimotor functions and are clinically the most frequent type of spinal cord injury . Understanding the motor impairments and the possible functional recovery of upper and lower extremities is of great importance . Animal models investigating motor dysfunction following cervical spinal cord injury are rare . We analysed the differential spontaneous recovery of fore - and hindlimb locomotion by detailed kinematic analysis in adult rats with unilateral C4 / C5 hemisection , a lesion that leads to the Brown - S quard syndrome in humans . The results showed disproportionately better performance of hindlimb compared with forelimb locomotion ; hindlimb locomotion showed substantial recovery , whereas the ipsilesional forelimb remained in a very poor functional state . Such a differential motor recovery pattern is also known to occur in monkeys and in humans after similar spinal cord lesions . On the lesioned side , cortico - , rubro - , vestibulo - and reticulospinal tracts and the important modulatory serotonergic , dopaminergic and noradrenergic fibre systems were interrupted by the lesion . In an attempt to facilitate locomotion , different monoaminergic agonists were injected intrathecally . Injections of specific serotonergic and noradrenergic agonists in the chronic phase after the spinal cord lesion revealed remarkable , although mostly functionally negative , modulations of particular parameters of hindlimb locomotion . In contrast , forelimb locomotion was mostly unresponsive to these agonists . These results , therefore , show fundamental differences between fore - and hindlimb spinal motor circuitries and their functional dependence on remaining descending inputs and exogenous spinal excitation . Understanding these differences may help to develop future therapeutic strategies to improve upper and lower limb function in patients with incomplete cervical spinal cord injuries .",drug
"Amphetamine locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference in adolescent male and female rats neonatally treated with quinpirole . Neonatal quinpirole treatment has been shown to produce an increase in dopamine D2 - like receptor sensitivity that persists throughout the subject ' s lifetime . The objective was to analyze the effects of neonatal quinpirole treatment on effects of amphetamine in adolescent rats using locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference procedures . Sprague - Dawley rats were treated with quinpirole ( 1 mg / kg ) or saline from postnatal days ( P ) 1 to P11 and raised to adolescence . For locomotor sensitization , subjects were given amphetamine ( 1 mg / kg ) or saline every second day from P35 to P47 and were placed into a locomotor arena . In female rats , neonatal quinpirole treatment enhanced amphetamine locomotor sensitization compared with quinpirole - free controls sensitized to amphetamine . Male rats demonstrated sensitization to amphetamine , although this was muted compared with female rats , and were unaffected by neonatal quinpirole . For conditioned place preference , subjects were conditioned for 8 consecutive days ( P32 - 39 ) with amphetamine ( 1 mg / kg ) or saline and a drug - free preference test was conducted at P40 . Rats treated with neonatal quinpirole enhanced time spent in the amphetamine - paired context compared with quinpirole - free controls conditioned with amphetamine , but only female controls conditioned with amphetamine spent more time in the drug - paired context compared with saline - treated controls . Increased D - like receptor sensitivity appears to have enhanced the behavioral effects of amphetamine , but these effects were more prevalent in adolescent female rats compared with male rats .",drug
"In vivo CYP3A activity is significantly lower in cyclosporine - treated as compared with tacrolimus - treated renal allograft recipients . In vitro studies have identified cyclosporine and tacrolimus as CYP3A inhibitors . In the current study in renal allograft recipients , we used intravenously and orally administered midazolam as a drug probe to assess whether the study drugs at doses that are generally used in clinical practice have differential effects on in vivo hepatic and first - pass CYP3A activities . Systemic and apparent oral midazolam clearance were 24 % ( 269 73 vs . 354 102 ml / min , P = 0 . 022 ) and 31 % ( 479 190 vs . 688 265 ml / min , P = 0 . 013 ) , respectively , lower in cyclosporine - treated patients ( n = 20 ) than in matched tacrolimus - treated patients ( n = 20 ) . The latter displayed midazolam clearances similar to those in two larger cohorts of nonmatched tacrolimus - treated patients ( n = 58 and n = 80 ) and to those receiving a calcineurin inhibitor - free regimen ( n = 6 ) . This implies that in vivo hepatic and first - pass CYP3A activities are significantly lower in patients receiving cyclosporine than in those receiving tacrolimus , indicating that , at the doses generally used in clinical practice , cyclosporine is the stronger of the two with respect to CYP3A inhibition . This observation has important implications in the context of drug - drug interactions in transplant recipients .",drug
"Improvement of colchicine oral bioavailability by incorporating eugenol in the nanoemulsion as an oil excipient and enhancer . The effect of eugenol on colchicine transport across an isolated rat intestinal membrane was studied using an in vitro diffusion chamber system . We found that eugenol increased the absorptive transport of the drug efficiently . The effect of eugenol on intestinal absorption of colchicine in an oral administrative nanoemulsion formulation was also demonstrated in vivo . The colchicine nanoemulsion was prepared with isopropyl myristate , eugenol , Tween80 , ethanol and water , and eugenol was used as an oil phase in the formulation ; an average particle size of this nanoemulsion was 41 . 2 7 . 2 nm . The permeation of colchicine in the nanoemulsion across the intestinal membrane was significantly different from that of the control group ( 0 . 2 mM colchicine ) . Finally , co - administration of eugenol in colchicine nanoemulsion to enhance the colchicine bioavailability was investigated by an oral administration method . After oral administration of colchicine ( 8 mg / kg ) in the form of either the nanoemulsion or in free colchicine solution , the relative bioavailability of nanoemulsion and eugenol - nanoemulsion were enhanced by about 1 . 6 - and 2 . 1 - fold , respectively , compared with free colchicine solution . The procedure indicated that the intestinal absorption of colchicine was enhanced significantly by eugenol in the tested nanoemulsion .

This study aimed to evaluate antimicrobial effects of an o - cymen - 5 - ol / zinc system . o - Cymen - 5 - ol and zinc gluconate minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) and minimum bactericidal concentration ( MBC ) were determined against Streptococcus mutans , Actinomyces viscosus , Porphyromonas gingivalis , Fusobacterium nucleatum and Candida albicans . Synergy was investigated by checkerboard MIC / MBC ; inhibition of P . gingivalis protease activity and S . mutans glycolysis were investigated . Slurried toothpastes containing the system were assessed in kill time assays against S . mutans and E . coli . o - Cymen - 5 - ol MIC was between 1 . 7 mM to 3 . 4 mM ; MBC was 3 . 4 mM to 6 . 7 mM . Zinc gluconate MIC was 2 . 8 mM to 11 mM ; MBC was between 11 mM and > 44 mM . The two agents in solution showed synergy ( FICI 0 . 50 ) against P . gingivalis and F . nucleatum , with MIC of 0 . 42 mM / 0 . 69 mM for o - cymen - 5 - ol / zinc gluconate , respectively . Zinc inhibited glycolysis and protease to a greater degree than o - cymen - 5 - ol ; glycolysis inhibition by the two agents was additive . o - Cymen - 5 - ol / zinc chloride in toothpaste showed greater effects than placebo ( 120s log10 kill = 7 . 35 0 . 40 and 4 . 02 0 . 40 , respectively ) . The zinc / o - cymen - 5 - ol system has direct antimicrobial effects and inhibits oral disease - related processes . Synergistic effects were seen against anaerobes .

"Improved parathyroid hormone control by cinacalcet is associated with reduction in darbepoetin requirement in patients with end - stage renal disease . Uncontrolled hy - per - parathyroidism causes bone marrow fibrosis , leading to erythropoietin ( EPO ) resistance . Medical treatment with cinacalcet is effective in reducing plasma parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) levels , but its effect on darbepoetin dosing is unknown . METHODS AND AIMS : We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 40 end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patients ( age : 55 14 ; mean SD ; 21 : male ) who had at least 12 months of cinacalcet therapy . The distribution of renal replacement therapies were : 14 peritoneal dialysis , 18 conventional hemodialysis and 8 nocturnal hemodialysis . Standard dialysis related biochemical indices and medications used were recorded . The primary objective of the study was to ascertain the difference in darbepoetin responsiveness before and after 12 months of cinacalcet therapy . Our secondary objective was to determine if there was a relationship between the changes in PTH and darbepoetin requirement . Overall , PTH levels decreased from 197 . 5 ( 151 . 8 ; 249 . 2 ) to 66 . 1 ( 41 . 2 ; 136 . 5 ) ( median ( 25th ; 75th percentile ) ) pmol / l ; p & lt ; 0 . 001 . Cinacalcet dose increased from 30 . 0 6 to 63 25 mg / day , p < 0 . 05 . Hemoglobin remained unchanged ( 116 13 to 116 13 g / l ) , while darbepoetin requirement decreased from 40 ( 20 ; 60 ) to 24 ( 19 ; 59 ) g / week , p = 0 . 02 . The remainder of the dialysis - related biochemistry ( electrolytes , calcium , phosphate , iron status ) and vitamin D use remained unchanged . A reduction in PTH level of greater than 30 % was experienced by 82 . 5 % ( 33 / 40 ) of our cohort . Among the responders , the fall in PTH and reduction darbepoetin requirement were related ( R = - 0 . 48 , p = 0 . 004 ) . Reduction of",drug

"Interaction of celecoxib with different anti - cancer drugs is antagonistic in breast but not in other cancer cells . Celecoxib , an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase - 2 , is being investigated for enhancement of chemotherapy efficacy in cancer clinical trials . This study investigates the ability of cyclooxygenase - 2 inhibitors to sensitize cells from different origins to several chemotherapeutic agents . The effect of the drug ' s mechanism of action and sequence of administration are also investigated . The sensitivity , cell cycle , apoptosis and DNA damage of five different cancer cell lines ( HeLa , HCT116 , HepG2 , MCF7 and U251 ) to 5 - FU , cisplatin , doxorubicin and etoposide celecoxib following different incubation schedules were analyzed . We found antagonism between celecoxib and the four drugs in the breast cancer cells MCF7 following all incubation schedules and between celecoxib and doxorubicin in all cell lines except for two combinations in HCT116 cells . Celecoxib with the other three drugs in the remaining four cell lines resulted in variable interactions . Mechanistic investigations revealed that celecoxib exerts different molecular effects in different cells . In some lines , it abrogates the drug - induced G2 / M arrest enhancing pre - mature entry into mitosis with damaged DNA thus increasing apoptosis and resulting in synergism . In other cells , it enhances drug - induced G2 / M arrest allowing time to repair drug - induced DNA damage before entry into mitosis and decreasing cell death resulting in antagonism . In some synergistic combinations , celecoxib - induced abrogation of G2 / M arrest was not associated with apoptosis but permanent arrest in G1 phase . These results , if confirmed in - vivo , indicate that celecoxib is not a suitable chemosensitizer for breast cancer or with doxorubicin for other cancers . Moreover , combination of celecoxib with other drugs should be tailored to the tumor type , drug and administration schedule .",drug
"Opportunities and challenges in the development of experimental drug combinations for cancer . It is becoming increasingly evident that cancers are dependent on a number of altered molecular pathways and can develop diverse mechanisms of resistance to therapy with single agents . Therefore , combination regimens may provide the best hope for effective therapies with durable effects . Despite preclinical data to support this notion , there are many challenges to the development of targeted combinations including scientific , economic , legal , and regulatory barriers . A discussion of these challenges and identification of models and best practices are presented with intent of aiding the research community in addressing real and perceived barriers to the development of combination therapies for cancer .",drug
"Network neighbors of drug targets contribute to drug side - effect similarity . In pharmacology , it is essential to identify the molecular mechanisms of drug action in order to understand adverse side effects . These adverse side effects have been used to infer whether two drugs share a target protein . However , side - effect similarity of drugs could also be caused by their target proteins being close in a molecular network , which as such could cause similar downstream effects . In this study , we investigated the proportion of side - effect similarities that is due to targets that are close in the network compared to shared drug targets . We found that only a minor fraction of side - effect similarities ( 5 . 8 % ) are caused by drugs targeting proteins close in the network , compared to side - effect similarities caused by overlapping drug targets ( 64 % ) . Moreover , these targets that cause similar side effects are more often in a linear part of the network , having two or less interactions , than drug targets in general . Based on the examples , we gained novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of side effects associated with several drug targets . Looking forward , such analyses will be extremely useful in the process of drug development to better understand adverse side effects .",drug
"[ Does implementation of benchmarking in quality circles improve the quality of care of patients with asthma and reduce drug interaction ] . The purpose of this cluster - randomised controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of quality circles ( QCs ) working either with general data - based feedback or with an open benchmark within the field of asthma care and drug - drug interactions . Twelve QCs , involving 96 general practitioners from 85 practices , were randomised . Six QCs worked with traditional anonymous feedback and six with an open benchmark . Two QC meetings supported with feedback reports were held covering the topics "" drug - drug interactions "" and "" asthma "" ; in both cases discussions were guided by a trained moderator . Outcome measures included health - related quality of life and patient satisfaction with treatment , asthma severity and number of potentially inappropriate drug combinations as well as the general practitioners ' satisfaction in relation to the performance of the QC . A significant improvement in the treatment of asthma was observed in both trial arms . However , there was only a slight improvement regarding inappropriate drug combinations . There were no relevant differences between the group with open benchmark ( B - QC ) and traditional quality circles ( T - QC ) . The physicians ' satisfaction with the QC performance was significantly higher in the T - QCs . General practitioners seem to take a critical perspective about open benchmarking in quality circles . Caution should be used when implementing benchmarking in a quality circle as it did not improve healthcare when compared to the traditional procedure with anonymised comparisons .",drug
"[ Interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors ] . The drug interaction between proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel has been the subject of much study in recent years . Contradictory results regarding the effect of proton pump inhibitors on platelet reactivity and on clinical outcome in clopidogrel - treated patients have been reported in literature . Concomitant use of omeprazole and clopidogrel was found to decrease the exposure ( AUC ) to clopidogrel ' s active metabolite by 50 % and to sharply increase platelet reactivity , as a result of inhibition by omeprazole of CYP2C19 , a cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzyme . Pantoprazole has a much weaker effect on clopidogrel ' s pharmacokinetics and on platelet reactivity during concomitant use . The influence of the other proton pump inhibitors when used simultaneously with clopidogrel has not yet been investigated in adequately randomized studies . Regulatory agencies state that the combination of clopidogrel and the CYP2C19 inhibitors omeprazole and esomeprazole should be avoided . To date , there is no conclusive evidence of a clinically - relevant interaction between any of the proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel .",drug
"ABC transporters influence sensitivity of Brugia malayi to moxidectin and have potential roles in drug resistance . Some ABC transporters play a significant role in human health and illness because they confer multidrug resistance ( MDR ) through their overexpression . Compounds that inhibit the drug efflux mechanism can improve efficacy or reverse resistance . Of the eight described ABC transporter subfamilies , those proteins conferring MDR in humans are in subfamilies A , B , C , and G . In nematodes , transporters in subfamilies B and C are suggested to confer resistance to ivermectin . The Brugia malayi ABC transporter superfamily was examined to assess their potential to influence sensitivity to moxidectin . There was an increase in expression of ABC transporters in subfamilies A , B , C , and G following treatment . Co - administration of moxidectin with inhibitors of ABC transporter function did not enhance sensitivity to moxidectin in males ; however , sensitivity was significantly enhanced in females and microfilariae . The work suggests that ABC transporters influence sensitivity to moxidectin and have a potential role in drug resistance .",drug
In vitro activity of minocycline combined with fosfomycin against clinical isolates of methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus . This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro activity of minocycline combined with fosfomycin against isolates of methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) . A total of 87 clinical isolates of MRSA collected from three Chinese hospitals were included in the study . The checkerboard method with determination of the fractional IC index ( FICI ) was used to determine whether antibiotic combinations act synergistically against these isolates . The susceptibility results for minocycline and fosfomycin were interpreted according to the most relevant criteria . The results demonstrated the following interactions : 76 isolates ( 87 . 4 % ) showed synergistic interactions ( FICI 0 . 5 ) and 11 isolates ( 12 . 6 % ) showed indifferent interactions ( 0 . 5 & lt ; FICI & lt ; 4 ) . No antagonistic interactions ( FICI 4 ) were observed . The combination of minocycline and fosfomycin can be synergistic against MRSA . Further studies are required to determine the potential clinical role of this combination regimen as a therapeutic alternative for certain types of MRSA infections .,drug
"The role of interneurons in shaping Purkinje cell responses in the cerebellar cortex . The well established anatomy of the cerebellar cortex has led to suggestions that cerebellar molecular layer interneurons laterally inhibit Purkinje cells . In support of the anatomical predictions , on - beam excitation and off - beam inhibition of Purkinje cells have been shown to occur when the surface of the cerebellum is electrically excited . Patchy excitation of Purkinje cells with flanking inhibition of sagittally oriented Purkinje cells have also been demonstrated following peripheral stimulation in vivo . To extend these observations , we mapped the functional connectivity between granule cells , molecular layer interneurons , and Purkinje cells in rats . Patches of granule cells were asynchronously activated by photostimulation to mimic their excitation by a mossy fiber as it occurs in vivo . We found with remarkable consistency that , in the sagittal orientation , granule cells elicit a stereotypic set of responses . Granule cells immediately underneath a Purkinje cell provide pure excitation . Granule cells positioned 340 - 400 m laterally provided pure inhibition , consistent with the lateral inhibition proposed earlier . The net effect of exciting granule cells in between these two extremes was to provide a systematic change in the response of Purkinje cells , from net excitation to net inhibition moving laterally from the Purkinje cell . In contrast to the sagittal orientation , in the coronal orientation the organization of Purkinje cell responses with granule cell activation was remarkably different . Independent of the location of granule cells , within the 480 m lateral distance examined , molecular layer interneurons reduced the strength of granule cell inputs to Purkinje cells to a comparable extent .",drug
"The influence of chemical activation on tooth bleaching using 10 % carbamide peroxide . The aim of this study was to assess the influence of manganese gluconate , a chemical activator of bleaching agents , at a concentration of 0 . 01 % on the efficiency of a 10 % carbamide peroxide - based bleaching agent . Forty bovine incisors were immersed in a 25 % instant coffee solution for seven days and randomly divided into two groups . Group 1 was the control group and consisted of 10 % carbamide peroxide - based bleaching gel only . Group 2 consisted of 10 % carbamide peroxide - based bleaching gel and 0 . 01 % manganese gluconate .

"Nitric oxide is an activity - dependent regulator of target neuron intrinsic excitability . Activity - dependent changes in synaptic strength are well established as mediating long - term plasticity underlying learning and memory , but modulation of target neuron excitability could complement changes in synaptic strength and regulate network activity . It is thought that homeostatic mechanisms match intrinsic excitability to the incoming synaptic drive , but evidence for involvement of voltage - gated conductances is sparse . Here , we show that glutamatergic synaptic activity modulates target neuron excitability and switches the basis of action potential repolarization from Kv3 to Kv2 potassium channel dominance , thereby adjusting neuronal signaling between low and high activity states , respectively . This nitric oxide - mediated signaling dramatically increases Kv2 currents in both the auditory brain stem and hippocampus ( & gt ; 3 - fold ) transforming synaptic integration and information transmission but with only modest changes in action potential waveform . We conclude that nitric oxide is a homeostatic regulator , tuning neuronal excitability to the recent history of excitatory synaptic inputs over intervals of minutes to hours .",drug
"Spontaneous spiking and synaptic depression underlie noradrenergic control of feed - forward inhibition . Inhibitory interneurons across diverse brain regions commonly exhibit spontaneous spiking activity , even in the absence of external stimuli . It is not well understood how stimulus - evoked inhibition can be distinguished from background inhibition arising from spontaneous firing . We found that noradrenaline simultaneously reduced spontaneous inhibitory inputs and enhanced evoked inhibitory currents recorded from principal neurons of the mouse dorsal cochlear nucleus ( DCN ) . Together , these effects produced a large increase in signal - to - noise ratio for stimulus - evoked inhibition . Surprisingly , the opposing effects on background and evoked currents could both be attributed to noradrenergic silencing of spontaneous spiking in glycinergic interneurons . During spontaneous firing , glycine release was decreased due to strong short - term depression . Elimination of background spiking relieved inhibitory synapses from depression and thereby enhanced stimulus - evoked inhibition . Our findings illustrate a simple yet powerful neuromodulatory mechanism to shift the balance between background and stimulus - evoked signals .",drug
"Approach to the evaluation of a patient with an increased serum osmolal gap and high - anion - gap metabolic acidosis . An increase in serum osmolality and serum osmolal gap with or without high - anion - gap metabolic acidosis is an important clue to exposure to one of the toxic alcohols , which include methanol , ethylene glycol , diethylene glycol , propylene glycol , or isopropanol . However , the increase in serum osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis can occur either together or alone depending on several factors , including baseline serum osmolal gap , molecular weight of the alcohol , and stage of metabolism of the alcohol . In addition , other disorders , including diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis , acute kidney injury , chronic kidney disease , and lactic acidosis , can cause high - anion - gap metabolic acidosis associated with an increased serum osmolal gap and therefore should be explored in the differential diagnosis . It is essential for clinicians to understand the value and limitations of osmolal gap to assist in reaching the correct diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment .

"Calcium does not inhibit the absorption of 5 milligrams of nonheme or heme iron at doses less than 800 milligrams in nonpregnant women . Calcium is the only known component in the diet that may affect absorption of both nonheme and heme iron . However , the evidence for a calcium effect on iron absorption mainly comes from studies that did not isolate the effect of calcium from that of other dietary components , because it was detected in single - meal studies . Our objective was to establish potential effects of calcium on absorption of nonheme and heme iron and the dose response for this effect in the absence of a meal . Fifty - four healthy , nonpregnant women were selected to participate in 4 iron absorption studies using iron radioactive tracers . We evaluated the effects of calcium doses between 200 and 1500 mg on absorption of 5 mg nonheme iron ( as ferrous sulfate ) . We also evaluated the effects of calcium doses between 200 and 800 mg on absorption of 5 mg heme iron [ as concentrated RBC ( CRBC ) ] . Calcium was administered as calcium chloride in all studies and minerals were ingested on an empty stomach . Calcium doses 1000 mg diminished nonheme iron absorption by an average of 49 . 6 % . A calcium dose of 800 mg diminished absorption of 5 mg heme iron by 37 . 7 % . In conclusion , we demonstrated an isolated effect of calcium ( as chloride ) on absorption of 5 mg of iron provided as nonheme ( as sulfate ) and heme ( as CRBC ) iron . This effect was observed at doses higher than previously reported from single - meal studies , starting at ~ 800 mg of calcium .",drug
"Synergistic interaction between sunitinib and docetaxel is sequence dependent in human non - small lung cancer with EGFR TKIs - resistant mutation . Previous studies have demonstrated that sunitinib has the anti - tumor activity in human non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . This study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of single use of sunitinib and that of concurrent or sequential administration of sunitinib and docetaxel in NSCLC cell lines that are resistant to EGFR TKIs . NSCLC cell lines with EGFR T790M mutation and K - ras mutation were exposed to either sunitinib or docetaxel or both based on various sequential administrations . After exposure , the cell viability was measured by MTT assay , cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry , and alterations in signaling pathway were determined by immunoblotting . Sunitinib exhibited dose - dependent growth inhibition in NSCLC cell lines and arrested cell cycle at G1 phase , whereas docetaxel arrested at S phase . Although single or concurrent use of sunitinib and docetaxel has some anti - proliferative effects , the sequential administrations of both drugs remarkably enhanced anti - tumor activity . When cells were exposed to docetaxel followed by sunitinib , synergism was observed . The molecular basis of this synergism is that the signaling pathways that were initially activated by docetaxel exposure were efficiently suppressed by the subsequent exposure to sunitinib . In contrast , the reverse of this sequential administration resulted in antagonism , which may be due to differential effects on cell cycle arrest . Sunitinib as a single agent exhibits anti - proliferative effects in vitro in NSCLC cell lines with EGFR T790M and K - ras mutations but the sequential administration of docetaxel followed by sunitinib is superior to sunitinib followed by docetaxel and concurrent administration .",drug

"Distinct synergistic action of piperacillin and methylglyoxal against Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The dicarbonyl compound methylglyoxal is a natural constituent of Manuka honey produced from Manuka flowers in New Zealand . It is known to possess both anticancer and antibacterial activity .

A total of 12 test P . aeruginosa strains isolated from various hospitals were tested for their resistances against many antibiotics , most of which are applied in the treatment of P . aeruginosa infections . Results revealed that the strains were resistant to many drugs at high levels , only piperacillin , carbenicillin , amikacin and ciprofloxacin showed resistances at comparatively lower levels . Following multiple experimentations it was observed that methylglyoxal was also antimicrobic against all the strains at comparable levels . Distinct and statistically significant synergism was observed between methylglyoxal and piperacillin by disc diffusion tests when compared with their individual effects .

"Protective effect of acetyl - l - carnitine and alpha lipoic acid against the acute toxicity of diepoxybutane to human lymphocytes . The biotransformation and oxidative stress may contribute to 1 , 2 : 3 , 4 - diepoxybutane ( DEB ) - induced toxicity to human lymphocytes of Fanconi Anemia ( FA ) patients . Thus , the identification of putative inhibitors of bioactivation , as well as the determination of the protective role of oxidant defenses , on DEB - induced toxicity , can help to understand what is failing in FA cells . In the present work we studied the contribution of several biochemical pathways for DEB - induced acute toxicity in human lymphocyte suspensions , by using inhibitors of epoxide hydrolases , inhibitors of protective enzymes as glutathione S - transferase and catalase , the depletion of glutathione ( GSH ) , and the inhibition of protein synthesis ; and a variety of putative protective compounds , including antioxidants , and mitochondrial protective agents . The present study reports two novel findings : ( i ) it was clearly evidenced , for the first time , that the acute exposure of freshly isolated human lymphocytes to DEB results in severe GSH depletion and loss of ATP , followed by cell death ; ( ii ) acetyl - l - carnitine elicits a significant protective effect on DEB induced toxicity , which was potentiated by alpha - lipoic acid . Collectively , these findings contribute to increase our knowledge of DEB - induce toxicity and will be very useful when applied in studies with lymphocytes from FA patients , in order to find out a protective agent against spontaneous and DEB - induced chromosome instability .",drug

"The role of p27 ( Kip1 ) in dasatinib - enhanced paclitaxel cytotoxicity in human ovarian cancer cells . Less than 50 % of ovarian cancers respond to paclitaxel . Effective strategies are needed to enhance paclitaxel sensitivity . A library of silencing RNAs ( siRNAs ) was used to identify kinases that regulate paclitaxel sensitivity in human ovarian cancer SKOv3 cells . The effect of dasatinib , an inhibitor of Src and Abl kinases , on paclitaxel sensitivity was measured in ovarian cancer cells and HEY xenografts . The roles of p27 ( Kip1 ) , Bcl - 2 , and Cdk1 in apoptosis induced by dasatinib and paclitaxel were assessed using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase - mediated dUTP nick - end labeling ( TUNEL ) assay , siRNA knockdown of gene expression , transfection with Bcl - 2 and Cdk1 expression vectors , and flow cytometry . All statistical tests were two - sided . Src family and Abl kinases were identified as modulators of paclitaxel sensitivity in SKOv3 cells . The siRNA knockdown of Src , Fyn , or Abl1 enhanced paclitaxel - mediated growth inhibition in ovarian cancer cells compared with a control siRNA .

"Identification of a dopamine receptor - mediated opiate reward memory switch in the basolateral amygdala - nucleus accumbens circuit . The basolateral amygdala ( BLA ) , ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) , and nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) play central roles in the processing of opiate - related associative reward learning and memory . The BLA receives innervation from dopaminergic fibers originating in the VTA , and both dopamine ( DA ) D1 and D2 receptors are expressed in this region . Using a combination of in vivo single - unit extracellular recording in the NAc combined with behavioral pharmacology studies , we have identified a double dissociation in the functional roles of DA D1 versus D2 receptor transmission in the BLA , which depends on opiate exposure state ; thus , in previously opiate - naive rats , blockade of intra - BLA D1 , but not D2 , receptor transmission blocked the acquisition of associative opiate reward memory , measured in an unbiased conditioned place preference procedure . In direct contrast , in rats made opiate dependent and conditioned in a state of withdrawal , intra - BLA D2 , but not D1 , receptor blockade blocked opiate reward encoding . This functional switch was dependent on cAMP signaling as comodulation of intra - BLA cAMP levels reversed or replicated the functional effects of intra - BLA D1 or D2 transmission during opiate reward processing . Single - unit in vivo extracellular recordings performed in neurons of the NAc confirmed an opiate - state - dependent role for BLA D1 / D2 transmission in NAc neuronal response patterns to morphine . Our results characterize and identify a novel opiate addiction switching mechanism directly in the BLA that can control the processing of opiate reward information as a direct function of opiate exposure state via D1 or D2 receptor signaling substrates .",drug

"[ Variability of cannabinoid findings in blood ] . Cannabis products have been administered for many centuries ; today , cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug all over the world . Nevertheless , the interpretation of cannabis findings in blood with regard to consumption behaviour and / or estimating the elapsed time since the last cannabis use is still a very challenging task . A wide variation of pharmacokinetic parameters has been observed even in experimental studies . Different chemical structures of precursors , smoking dynamics , pyrolysis of phytocannabinoids and frequency of drug use affect the amount of THC absorbed . Polymorphic enzymes are involved in phase - I - metabolism of THC . Pharmacological effects of other cannabinoids or medication on the pharmacokinetics of THC have not yet been studied in detail . Hydrolysis of cannabis conjugates may occur during storage of blood samples and processing of specimens for analysis ; knowledge on the stability of cannabinoids in forensic specimens is still poor . Whether determination of cannabinoid conjugates may be useful is a matter of further consideration .

"Oligophrenin - 1 regulates dendritic spine morphology in the brain . Mutations in the oligophrenin - 1 gene ( OPHN1 ) cause intellectual disability . We discovered a previously unknown partner of oligophrenin - 1 , Rev - erb , a nuclear receptor that represses the transcription of circadian oscillators . We found that oligophrenin - 1 interacts with Rev - erb in the mouse brain , causing it to locate to dendrites , reducing its repressor activity and protecting it from degradation . Our results indicate the presence of a circadian oscillator in the hippocampus , involving the clock gene Bmal1 ( also known as Arntl ) , that is modulated by Rev - erb and requires oligophrenin - 1 for normal oscillation . We also found that synaptic activity induced Rev - erb localization to dendrites and spines , a process that is mediated by AMPA receptor activation and requires oligophrenin - 1 .

The animals were received ; saline + saline , ephedrine ( 10 mg / kg ) + saline , saline + dexmedetomidine ( 15 g / kg ) and ephedrine ( 10 mg / kg ) + dexmedetomidine ( 15 g / kg ) , intraperitoneally , 30 min before hot plate or holed open field tests . In the hot plate test in mice , co - administration of 15 g / kg dexmedetomidine with 10 mg / kg ephedrine intraperitoneally not only enhanced , but also prolonged the duration of antinociception induced by dexmedetomidine . At the same time , the locomotor inhibitory effect of dexmedetomidine was counteracted by ephedrine . We concluded that the combined administration of dexmedetomidine with ephedrine may have beneficial effects in the treatment of pain without causing sedation , which limits the use of dexmedetomidine as an analgesic in humans .",drug

"Positive shifts of the GABAA receptor reversal potential due to altered chloride homeostasis is widespread after status epilepticus . - Aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) ergic transmission plays an important role in the initiation of epileptic activity and the generation of ictal discharges . The functional alterations in the epileptiform hippocampus critically depend on GABAergic mechanisms and cation - chloride cotransporters . To understand the cellular basis of specific functional alterations in the epileptic hippocampus , we studied physiologic characteristics and pharmacologically isolated evoked GABA ( A ) receptor - mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents ( IPSCs ) recorded from principal neurons in hippocampal slices from status epilepticus ( SE ) and control rats using whole - cell and gramicidin perforated patch - clamp recordings . Whereas the resting membrane potential and input resistance were not significantly different between control and epileptic tissue , the reversal potential ( E ( GABA ) ) of IPSCs was significantly shifted to more positive values in SE rats with regard to the resting membrane potential . Pharmacologic experiments and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) showed that the observed changes in the epileptic tissue were due to a decreased ratio of the main Cl ( - ) extrusion transporter ( K ( + ) - Cl ( - ) cotransporter , KCC2 ) to the main Cl ( - ) uptake transporter ( Na ( + ) - K ( + ) - 2Cl ( - ) cotransporter , NKCC1 ) .

All the tests were carried out in the following seven groups ( n = 6 in each group ) , drugs being given orally ( doses for mice ) : Group 1 ( vehicle ) , group 2 ( curcumin 50 mg / kg ) , group 3 ( curcumin 100 mg / kg ) , group 4 ( fluoxetine 20 mg / kg ) , group 5 ( imipramine 15 mg / kg ) , group 6 ( curcumin 100 mg / kg plus fluoxetine 20 mg / kg ) and group 7 ( curcumin 100 mg / kg plus imipramine 15 mg / kg ) . Equivalent doses for rats were used . Both the acute model of FST and TST , and the chronic model of FST with water wheel showed significant antidepressant like activity of curcumin in 100 mg / kg dose as compared to vehicle control ( p < 0 . 05 ) . The effect of curcumin ( 100 mg / kg ) was similar to that of fluoxetine and imipramine ( p > 0 . 05 ) but its addition to fluoxetine and imipramine did not improve their antidepressant activity ( p > 0 . 05 ) . Curcumin increased both the swimming and climbing behavior in FST , thus its antidepressant like activity could be due to an increase in serotonin , norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the brain . Curcumin can be a useful antidepressant especially in cases which respond to drugs having mixed effects on serotonin and catecholamines levels in the brain .",drug

"Genetic mapping of the copper toxicosis locus in Bedlington terriers to dog chromosome 10 , in a region syntenic to human chromosome region 2p13 - p16 . Abnormal hepatic copper accumulation is recognized as an inherited disorder in man , mouse , rat and dog . The major cause of hepatic copper accumulation in man is a dysfunctional ATP7B gene , causing Wilson disease ( WD ). Mutations in the ATP7B genes have also been demonstrated in mouse and rat . The ATP7B gene has been excluded in the much rarer human copper overload disease non - Indian childhood cirrhosis , indicating genetic heterogeneity . By investigating the common autosomal recessive copper toxicosis ( CT ) in Bedlington terriers , we have identified a new locus involved in progressive liver disease . We examined whether the WD gene ATP7B was also causative for CT by investigating the chromosomal co - localization of ATP7B and C04107 , using fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ). C04107 is an anonymous microsatellite marker closely linked to CT . However , BAC clones containing ATP7B and C04107 mapped to the canine chromosome regions CFA22q11 and CFA10q26 , respectively , demonstrating that WD cannot be homologous to CT . The copper transport genes CTR1 and CTR2 were also excluded as candidate genes for CT since they both mapped to canine chromosome region CFA11q22 . 2 - 22 . 5 . A transcribed sequence identified from the C04107 - containing BAC was found to be homologous to a gene expressed from human chromosome 2p13 - p16 , a region devoid of any positional candidate genes .",disease
"Molecular analysis of the APC gene in 205 families : extended genotype - phenotype correlations in FAP and evidence for the role of APC amino acid changes in colorectal cancer predisposition . BACKGROUND / AIMS The development of colorectal cancer and a variable range of extracolonic manifestations in familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is the result of the dominant inheritance of adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene mutations . In this study , direct mutation analysis of the APC gene was performed to determine genotype - phenotype correlations for nine extracolonic manifestations and to investigate the incidence of APC mutations in non - FAP colorectal cancer . METHODS The APC gene was analysed in 190 unrelated FAP and 15 non - FAP colorectal cancer patients using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis , the protein truncation test , and direct sequencing . RESULTS Chain terminating signals were only identified in patients belonging to the FAP group ( 105 patients ). Amino acid changes were identified in four patients , three of whom belonged to the non - FAP group of colorectal cancer patients . Genotype - phenotype correlations identified significant differences in the nature of certain extracolonic manifestations in FAP patients belonging to three mutation subgroups . CONCLUSIONS Extended genotype - phenotype correlations made in this study may have the potential to determine the most appropriate surveillance and prophylactic treatment regimens for those patients with mutations associated with life threatening conditions . This study also provided evidence for the pathological nature of amino acid changes in APC associated with both FAP and non - FAP colorectal cancer patients ..",disease
"A European multicenter study of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency : classification of 105 mutations and a general system for genotype - based prediction of metabolic phenotype . Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) and mild hyperphenylalaninemia ( MHP ) are allelic disorders caused by mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ). Previous studies have suggested that the highly variable metabolic phenotypes of PAH deficiency correlate with PAH genotypes . We identified both causative mutations in 686 patients from seven European centers . On the basis of the phenotypic characteristics of 297 functionally hemizygous patients , 105 of the mutations were assigned to one of four arbitrary phenotype categories . We proposed and tested a simple model for correlation between genotype and phenotypic outcome . The observed phenotype matched the predicted phenotype in 79 % of the cases , and in only 5 of 184 patients was the observed phenotype more than one category away from that expected . Among the seven contributing centers , the proportion of patients for whom the observed phenotype did not match the predicted phenotype was 4 % - 23 % ( P <. 0001 ), suggesting that differences in methods used for mutation detection or phenotype classification may account for a considerable proportion of genotype - phenotype inconsistencies . Our data indicate that the PAH - mutation genotype is the main determinant of metabolic phenotype in most patients with PAH deficiency . In the present study , the classification of 105 PAH mutations may allow the prediction of the biochemical phenotype in > 10 , 000 genotypes , which may be useful for the management of hyperphenylalaninemia in newborns .",disease
"Disruption of splicing regulated by a CUG - binding protein in myotonic dystrophy . Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is caused by a CTG expansion in the 3 untranslated region of the DM gene . One model of DM pathogenesis suggests that RNAs from the expanded allele create a gain - of - function mutation by the inappropriate binding of proteins to the CUG repeats . Data presented here indicate that the conserved heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein , CUG - binding protein ( CUG - BP ), may mediate the trans - dominant effect of the RNA . CUG - BP was found to bind to the human cardiac troponin T ( cTNT ) pre - messenger RNA and regulate its alternative splicing . Splicing of cTNT was disrupted in DM striated muscle and in normal cells expressing transcripts that contain CUG repeats . Altered expression of genes regulated posttranscriptionally by CUG - BP therefore may contribute to DM pathogenesis ..",disease
"Maternal disomy and Prader - Willi syndrome consistent with gamete complementation in a case of familial translocation ( 3 ; 15 ) ( p25 ; q11 . 2 ). Maternal uniparental disomy ( UPD ) for chromosome 15 is responsible for an estimated 30 % of cases of Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS ). We report on an unusual case of maternal disomy 15 in PWS that is most consistent with adjacent - 1 segregation of a paternal t ( 3 ; 15 ) ( p25 ; q11 . 2 ) with simultaneous maternal meiotic nondisjunction for chromosome 15 . The patient ( J . B . ), a 17 - year - old white male with PWS , was found to have 47 chromosomes with a supernumerary , paternal der ( 15 ) consisting of the short arm and the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 , and distal chromosome arm 3p . The t ( 3 ; 15 ) was present in the balanced state in the patients father and a sister . Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that the PWS critical region resided on the derivative chromosome 3 and that there was no deletion of the PWS region on the normal pair of 15s present in J . B . Methylation analysis at exon alpha of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein - associated polypeptide N ( SNRPN ) gene showed a pattern characteristic of only the maternal chromosome 15 in J . B . Maternal disomy was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of microsatellite repeats at the gamma - aminobutyric acid receptor beta3 subunit ( GABRB3 ) locus . A niece ( B . B .) with 45 chromosomes and the derivative 3 but without the der ( 15 ) demonstrated a phenotype consistent with that reported for haploinsufficiency of distal 3 p . Uniparental disomy associated with unbalanced segregation of non - Robertsonian translocations has been reported previously but has not , to our knowledge , been observed in a case of PWS . Furthermore , our findings are best interpreted as true gamete complementation resulting in maternal UPD 15 and PWS",disease
"Segregation distortion in myotonic dystrophy . Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is an autosomal dominant disease which , in the typical pedigree , shows a three generation anticipation cascade . This results in infertility and congenital myotonic dystrophy ( CDM ) with the disappearance of DM in that pedigree . The concept of segregation distortion , where there is preferential transmission of the larger allele at the DM locus , has been put forward to explain partially the maintenance of DM in the population . In a survey of DM in Northern Ireland , 59 pedigrees were ascertained . Sibships where the status of all the members had been identified were examined to determine the transmission of the DM expansion from affected parents to their offspring . Where the transmitting parent was male , 58 . 3 % of the offspring were affected , and in the case of a female transmitting parent , 68 . 7 % were affected . Studies on meiotic drive in DM have shown increased transmission of the larger allele at the DM locus in non - DM heterozygotes for CTGn . This study provides further evidence that the DM expansion tends to be transmitted preferentially .",disease
"Ataxia - telangiectasia : identification and detection of founder - effect mutations in the ATM gene in ethnic populations . To facilitate the evaluation of ATM heterozygotes for susceptibility to other diseases , such as breast cancer , we have attempted to define the most common mutations and their frequencies in ataxia - telangiectasia ( A - T ) homozygotes from 10 ethnic populations . Both genomic mutations and their effects on cDNA were characterized . Protein - truncation testing of the entire ATM cDNA detected 92 ( 66 %) truncating mutations in 140 mutant alleles screened . The haplotyping of patients with identical mutations indicates that almost all of these represent common ancestry and that very few spontaneously recurring ATM mutations exist . Assays requiring minimal amounts of genomic DNA were designed to allow rapid screening for common ethnic mutations . These rapid assays detected mutations in 76 % of Costa Rican patients ( 3 ), 50 % of Norwegian patients ( 1 ), 25 % of Polish patients ( 4 ), and 14 % of Italian patients ( 1 ), as well as in patients of Amish / Mennonite and Irish English backgrounds . Additional mutations were observed in Japanese , Utah Mormon , and African American patients . These assays should facilitate screening for A - T heterozygotes in the populations studied ..",disease
"Constitutional RB1 - gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma . In most patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma , tumor development is initiated by somatic inactivation of both alleles of the RB1 gene . However , some of these patients can transmit retinoblastoma predisposition to their offspring . To determine the frequency and nature of constitutional RB1 - gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma , we analyzed DNA from peripheral blood and from tumor tissue . The analysis of tumors from 54 ( 71 %) of 76 informative patients showed loss of constitutional heterozygosity ( LOH ) at intragenic loci . Three of 13 uninformative patients had constitutional deletions . For 39 randomly selected tumors , SSCP , hetero - duplex analysis , sequencing , and Southern blot analysis were used to identify mutations . Mutations were detected in 21 ( 91 %) of 23 tumors with LOH . In 6 ( 38 %) of 16 tumors without LOH , one mutation was detected , and in 9 ( 56 %) of the tumors without LOH , both mutations were found . Thus , a total of 45 mutations were identified in tumors of 36 patients . Thirty - nine of the mutations - including 34 small mutations , 2 large structural alterations , and hypermethylation in 3 tumors - were not detected in the corresponding peripheral blood DNA . In 6 ( 17 %) of the 36 patients , a mutation was detected in constitutional DNA , and 1 of these mutations is known to be associated with reduced expressivity . The presence of a constitutional mutation was not associated with an early age at treatment . In 1 patient , somatic mosaicism was demonstrated by molecular analysis of DNA and RNA from peripheral blood . In 2 patients without a detectable mutation in peripheral blood , mosaicism was suggested because 1 of the patients showed multifocal tumors and the other later developed bilateral retinoblastoma . In conclusion , our results emphasize that the manifestation and transmissibility of retinoblastoma depend on the nature of the first mutation , its time in development , and the number and types of cells that are affected ..",disease
"Missense mutations in the most ancient residues of the PAX6 paired domain underlie a spectrum of human congenital eye malformations . Mutations of the human PAX6 gene underlie aniridia ( congenital absence of the iris ), a rare dominant malformation of the eye . The spectrum of PAX6 mutations in aniridia patients is highly biased , with 92 % of all reported mutations leading to premature truncation of the protein ( nonsense , splicing , insertions and deletions ) and just 2 % leading to substitution of one amino acid by another ( missense ). The extraordinary conservation of the PAX6 protein at the amino acid level amongst vertebrates predicts that pathological missense mutations should in fact be common even though they are hardly ever seen in aniridia patients . This indicates that there is a heavy ascertainment bias in the selection of patients for PAX6 mutation analysis and that the missing PAX6 missense mutations frequently may underlie phenotypes distinct from textbook aniridia . Here we present four novel PAX6 missense mutations , two in association with atypical phenotypes ectopia pupillae ( displaced pupils ) and congenital nystagmus ( searching gaze ), and two in association with more recognizable aniridia phenotypes . Strikingly , all four mutations are located within the PAX6 paired domain and affect amino acids which are highly conserved in all known paired domain proteins . Our results support the hypothesis that the under - representation of missense mutations is caused by ascertainment bias and suggest that a substantial burden of PAX6 - related disease remains to be uncovered ..",disease
"Somatic instability of the CTG repeat in mice transgenic for the myotonic dystrophy region is age dependent but not correlated to the relative intertissue transcription levels and proliferative capacities . A ( CTG ) nexpansion in the 3 - untranslated region ( UTR ) of the DM protein kinase gene ( DMPK ) is responsible for causing myotonic dystrophy ( DM ). Major instability , with very large expansions between generations and high levels of somatic mosaicism , is observed in patients . There is a good correlation between repeat size ( at least in leucocytes ), clinical severity and age of onset . The trinucleotide repeat instability mechanisms involved in DM and other human genetic diseases are unknown . We studied somatic instability by measuring the CTG repeat length at several ages in various tissues of transgenic mice carrying a ( CTG ) 55expansion surrounded by 45 kb of the human DM region , using small - pool PCR . These mice have been shown to reproduce the intergenerational and somatic instability of the 55 CTG repeat suggesting that surrounding sequences and the chromatin environment are involved in instability mechanisms . As observed in some of the tissues of DM patients , there is a tendency for repeat length and somatic mosaicism to increase with the age of the mouse . Furthermore , we observed no correlation between the somatic mutation rate and tissue proliferation capacity . The somatic mutation rates in different tissues were also not correlated to the relative inter - tissue difference in transcriptional levels of the three genes ( DMAHP , DMPK and 59 ) surrounding the repeat ..",disease
"ATM mutations and phenotypes in ataxia - telangiectasia families in the British Isles : expression of mutant ATM and the risk of leukemia , lymphoma , and breast cancer . We report the spectrum of 59 ATM mutations observed in ataxia - telangiectasia ( A - T ) patients in the British Isles . Of 51 ATM mutations identified in families native to the British Isles , 11 were founder mutations , and 2 of these 11 conferred a milder clinical phenotype with respect to both cerebellar degeneration and cellular features . We report , in two A - T families , an ATM mutation ( 7271T -- > G ) that may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both homozygotes and heterozygotes ( relative risk 12 . 7 ; P =. 0025 ), although there is a less severe A - T phenotype in terms of the degree of cerebellar degeneration . This mutation ( 7271T -- > G ) also allows expression of full - length ATM protein at a level comparable with that in unaffected individuals . In addition , we have studied 18 A - T patients , in 15 families , who developed leukemia , lymphoma , preleukemic T - cell proliferation , or Hodgkin lymphoma , mostly in childhood . A wide variety of ATM mutation types , including missense mutations and in - frame deletions , were seen in these patients .

"Low frequency of BRCA1 germline mutations in 45 German breast / ovarian cancer families . In this study we investigated 45 German breast / ovarian cancer families for germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene . We identified four germline mutations in three breast cancer families and in one breast - ovarian cancer family . among these were one frameshift mutation , one nonsense mutation , one novel splice site mutation , and one missense mutation . The missense mutation was also found in 2 . 8 % of the general population , suggesting that it is not disease associated . The average age of disease onset in those families harbouring causative mutations was between 32 . 3 and 37 . 4 years , whereas the family harbouring the missense mutation had an average age of onset of 51 . 2 years . These findings show that BRCA1 is implicated in a small fraction of breast / ovarian cancer families suggesting the involvement of another susceptibility gene ( s )",disease
"Oral contraceptives and the risk of hereditary ovarian cancer . Hereditary Ovarian Cancer Clinical Study Group . BACKGROUND Women with mutations in either the BRCA1 or the BRCA2 gene have a high lifetime risk of ovarian cancer . Oral contraceptives protect against ovarian cancer in general , but it is not known whether they also protect against hereditary forms of ovarian cancer . METHODS We enrolled 207 women with hereditary ovarian cancer and 161 of their sisters as controls in a case - control study . All the patients carried a pathogenic mutation in either BRCA1 ( 179 women ) or BRCA2 ( 28 women ). The control women were enrolled regardless of whether or not they had either mutation . Lifetime histories of oral - contraceptive use were obtained by interview or by written questionnaire and were compared between patients and control women , after adjustment for year of birth and parity . RESULTS The adjusted odds ratio for ovarian cancer associated with any past use of oral contraceptives was 0 . 5 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 3 to 0 . 8 ). The risk decreased with increasing duration of use ( P for trend , < 0 . 001 ); use for six or more years was associated with a 60 percent reduction in risk . Oral - contraceptive use protected against ovarian cancer both for carriers of the BRCA1 mutation ( odds ratio , 0 . 5 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 3 to 0 . 9 ) and for carriers of the BRCA2 mutation ( odds ratio , 0 . 4 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 2 to 1 . 1 ).

"Founder BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in French Canadian breast and ovarian cancer families . We have identified four mutations in each of the breast cancer - susceptibility genes , BRCA1 and BRCA2 , in French Canadian breast cancer and breast / ovarian cancer families from Quebec . To identify founder effects , we examined independently ascertained French Canadian cancer families for the distribution of these eight mutations . Mutations were found in 41 of 97 families . Six of eight mutations were observed at least twice . The BRCA1 C4446T mutation was the most common mutation found , followed by the BRCA2 8765delAG mutation . Together , these mutations were found in 28 of 41 families identified to have a mutation . The odds of detection of any of the four BRCA1 mutations was 18 . 7x greater if one or more cases of ovarian cancer were also present in the family . The odds of detection of any of the four BRCA2 mutations was 5 . 3x greater if there were at least five cases of breast cancer in the family . Interestingly , the presence of a breast cancer case < 36 years of age was strongly predictive of the presence of any of the eight mutations screened . Carriers of the same mutation , from different families , shared similar haplotypes , indicating that the mutant alleles were likely to be identical by descent for a mutation in the founder population . The identification of common BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations will facilitate carrier detection in French Canadian breast cancer and breast / ovarian cancer families .",disease
"Truncation mutations in the transactivation region of PAX6 result in dominant - negative mutants . PAX6 is a transcription factor with two DNA - binding domains ( paired box and homeobox ) and a proline - serine - threonine ( PST ) - rich transactivation domain . PAX6 regulates eye development in animals ranging from jellyfish to Drosophila to humans . Heterozygous mutations in the human PAX6 gene result in various phenotypes , including aniridia , Peters anomaly , autosomal dominant keratitis , and familial foveal dysplasia . It is believed that the mutated allele of PAX6 produces an inactive protein and aniridia is caused due to genetic haploinsufficiency . However , several truncation mutations have been found to occur in the C - terminal half of PAX6 in patients with Aniridia resulting in mutant proteins that retain the DNA - binding domains but have lost most of the transactivation domain . It is not clear whether such mutants really behave as loss - of - function mutants as predicted by haploinsufficiency . Contrary to this theory , our data showed that these mutants are dominant - negative in transient transfection assays when they are coexpressed with wild - type PAX6 . We found that the dominant - negative effects result from the enhanced DNA binding ability of these mutants . Kinetic studies of binding and dissociation revealed that various truncation mutants have 3 - 5 - fold higher affinity to various DNA - binding sites when compared with the wild - type PAX6 . These results provide a new insight into the role of mutant PAX6 in causing aniridia ..",disease
"Crystal structure of the hemochromatosis protein HFE and characterization of its interaction with transferrin receptor . HFE is an MHC - related protein that is mutated in the iron - overload disease hereditary hemochromatosis . HFE binds to transferrin receptor ( TfR ) and reduces its affinity for iron - loaded transferrin , implicating HFE in iron metabolism . The 2 . 6 A crystal structure of HFE reveals the locations of hemochromatosis mutations and a patch of histidines that could be involved in pH - dependent interactions . We also demonstrate that soluble TfR and HFE bind tightly at the basic pH of the cell surface , but not at the acidic pH of intracellular vesicles . TfR HFE stoichiometry ( 2 1 ) differs from TfR transferrin stoichiometry ( 2 2 ), implying a different mode of binding for HFE and transferrin to TfR , consistent with our demonstration that HFE , transferrin , and TfR form a ternary complex .",disease
"Stable interaction between the products of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes in mitotic and meiotic cells . BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for most cases of familial , early onset breast and / or ovarian cancer and encode products that each interact with hRAD51 . Results presented here show that BRCA1 and BRCA2 coexist in a biochemical complex and colocalize in subnuclear foci in somatic cells and on the axial elements of developing synaptonemal complexes . Like BRCA1 and RAD51 , BRCA2 relocates to PCNA + replication sites following exposure of S phase cells to hydroxyurea or UV irradiation . Thus , BRCA1 and BRCA2 participate , together , in a pathway ( s ) associated with the activation of double - strand break repair and / or homologous recombination . Dysfunction of this pathway may be a general phenomenon in the majority of cases of hereditary breast and / or ovarian cancer ..",disease
"A novel Arg362Ser mutation in the sterol 27 - hydroxylase gene ( CYP27 ): its effects on pre - mRNA splicing and enzyme activity . A novel C to A mutation in the sterol 27 - hydroxylase gene ( CYP27 ) was identified by sequencing amplified CYP27 gene products from a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis ( CTX ). The mutation changed the adrenodoxin cofactor binding residue 362Arg to 362Ser ( CGT 362Arg to AGT 362Ser ), and was responsible for deficiency in the sterol 27 - hydroxylase activity , as confirmed by expression of mutant cDNA into COS - 1 cells . Quantitative analysis showed that the expression of CYP27 gene mRNA in the patient represented 52 . 5 % of the normal level . As the mutation occurred at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 (- 2 position of exon 6 - intron 6 splice site ) of the gene , we hypothesized that the mutation may partially affect the normal splicing efficiency in exon 6 and cause alternative splicing elsewhere , which resulted in decreased transcript in the patient . Transfection of constructed minigenes , with or without the mutation , into COS - 1 cells confirmed that the mutant minigene was responsible for a mRNA species alternatively spliced at an activated cryptic 5 splice site 88 bp upstream from the 3 end of exon 6 . Our data suggest that the C to A mutation at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 of the CYP27 gene not only causes the deficiency in the sterol 27 - hydroxylase activity , but also partially leads to alternative pre - mRNA splicing of the gene . To our knowledge , this is the first report regarding effects on pre - mRNA splicing of a mutation at the - 2 position of a 5 splice site .",disease

We report a Japanese family with adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) with a three base pair deletion ( delGAG 291 ) in the ALD gene . A variety of phenotypes were observed within this family . While the proband ( patient 1 ) was classified as having a rare intermediate type of adult cerebral and cerebello - brain stem forms , his younger brother ( patient 2 ) and nephew ( patient 3 ) had a childhood ALD type . Another nephew ( patient 4 ) of patient 1 was classified as having an adolescent form . The tau level in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) in patient 1 was as high as that of patients with Alzheimers disease ( AD ). His brain magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) showed abnormalities in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and brain stem , but not in the cerebral white matter , where marked reductions of the cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism were clearly demonstrated by positron emission tomography ( PET ). In patients 2 and 3 , the autopsy findings showed massive demyelination of the cerebral white matter with sparing of the U - fibers , compatible with the findings of childhood ALD . Oleic and erucic acids ( Lorenzos Oil ) were administered to patients 1 and 4 , but sufficient effectiveness was not obtained . The findings in this family suggest that delGAG291 is part of the cause of Japanese ALD with phenotypic variations . Moreover , although the scale of the study is limited , there is a possibility that PET can detect an insidious lesion which is undetectable by computed tomogram ( CT ) or MRI analysis , and that the higher level of tau reflects the process of neuronal degeneration in ALD . Lorenzos Oil should be given in the early stage ..",disease
"Two frequent missense mutations in Pendred syndrome . Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early childhood deafness and goiter . A century after its recognition as a syndrome by Vaughan Pendred , the disease gene ( PDS ) was mapped to chromosome 7q22 - q31 . 1 and , recently , found to encode a putative sulfate transporter . We performed mutation analysis of the PDS gene in patients from 14 Pendred families originating from seven countries and identified all mutations . The mutations include three single base deletions , one splice site mutation and 10 missense mutations . One missense mutation ( L236P ) was found in a homozygous state in two consanguineous families and in a heterozygous state in five additional non - consanguineous families . Another missense mutation ( T416P ) was found in a homozygous state in one family and in a heterozygous state in four families . Pendred patients in three non - consanguineous families were shown to be compound heterozygotes for L236P and T416P . In total , one or both of these mutations were found in nine of the 14 families analyzed .

"Mutation spectrum and genotype - phenotype analyses in Cowden disease and Bannayan - Zonana syndrome , two hamartoma syndromes with germline PTEN mutation . The tumour suppressor gene PTEN , which maps to 10q23 . 3 and encodes a 403 amino acid dual specificity phosphatase ( protein tyrosine phosphatase ; PTPase ), was shown recently to play a broad role in human malignancy . Somatic PTEN deletions and mutations were observed in sporadic breast , brain , prostate and kidney cancer cell lines and in several primary tumours such as endometrial carcinomas , malignant melanoma and thyroid tumours . In addition , PTEN was identified as the susceptibility gene for two hamartoma syndromes Cowden disease ( CD ; MIM 158350 ) and Bannayan - Zonana ( BZS ) or Ruvalcaba - Riley - Smith syndrome ( MIM 153480 ). Constitutive DNA from 37 CD families and seven BZS families was screened for germline PTEN mutations . PTEN mutations were identified in 30 of 37 ( 81 %) CD families , including missense and nonsense point mutations , deletions , insertions , a deletion / insertion and splice site mutations . These mutations were scattered over the entire length of PTEN , with the exception of the first , fourth and last exons . A hot spot for PTEN mutation in CD was identified in exon 5 that contains the PTPase core motif , with 13 of 30 ( 43 %) CD mutations identified in this exon . Seven of 30 ( 23 %) were within the core motif , the majority ( five of seven ) of which were missense mutations , possibly pointing to the functional significance of this region .

"Wilms ' tumor 1 and Dax - 1 modulate the orphan nuclear receptor SF - 1 in sex - specific gene expression . Products of steroidogenic factor 1 ( SF - 1 ) and Wilms tumor 1 ( WT1 ) genes are essential for mammalian gonadogenesis prior to sexual differentiation . In males , SF - 1 participates in sexual development by regulating expression of the polypeptide hormone Mullerian inhibiting substance ( MIS ). Here , we show that WT1 - KTS isoforms associate and synergize with SF - 1 to promote MIS expression . In contrast , WT1 missense mutations , associated with male pseudohermaphroditism in Denys - Drash syndrome , fail to synergize with SF - 1 . Additionally , the X - linked , candidate dosage - sensitive sex - reversal gene , Dax - 1 , antagonizes synergy between SF - 1 and WT1 , most likely through a direct interaction with SF - 1 .

"Ethnic differences in the HFE codon 282 ( Cys / Tyr ) polymorphism . Recent studies have shown that hereditary hemochromatosis ( HH ) is likely to be caused by homozygosity for a Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene located 4 . 5 Mb telomeric to HLA - A . Population studies of this polymorphism are facilitated by the fact that the Cys282Tyr mutation creates a Rsal restriction site . We have studied the codon 282 ( Cys / Tyr ) polymorphism in different ethnic groups . In agreement with previous observations the Tyr allele appeared to be rare or absent in Asiatic ( Indian , Chinese ) populations . The highest allele frequency ( 7 . 5 %) was found in Swedes . Saamis ( 2 %) and Mordvinians ( 1 . 8 %) had significantly lower frequencies of the Tyr allele . Comparisons with allele frequencies based on prevalence estimates of HH showed some disagreements with the RFLP data , particularly in Finns .

"Risk reversals in predictive testing for Huntington disease . The first predictive testing for Huntington disease ( HD ) was based on analysis of linked polymorphic DNA markers to estimate the likelihood of inheriting the mutation for HD . Limits to accuracy included recombination between the DNA markers and the mutation , pedigree structure , and whether DNA samples were available from family members . With direct tests for the HD mutation , we have assessed the accuracy of results obtained by linkage approaches when requested to do so by the test individuals . For six such individuals , there was significant disparity between the tests . Three went from a decreased risk to an increased risk , while in another three the risk was decreased . Knowledge of the potential reasons for these changes in results and impact of these risk reversals on both patients and the counseling team can assist in the development of strategies for the prevention and , where necessary , management of a risk reversal in any predictive testing program ..",disease

Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome is a progressive hematuric glomerulonephritis characterized by glomerular basement membrane abnormalities and associated with mutations in either the COL4A3 or the COL4A4 gene , which encode the alpha3 and alpha4 type IV collagen chains , respectively . To date , mutation screening in the two genes has been hampered by the lack of genomic structure information . We report here the complete characterization of the 48 exons of the COL4A4 gene , a comprehensive gene screen , and the subsequent detection of 10 novel mutations in eight patients diagnosed with autosomal recessive Alport syndrome . Furthermore , we identified a glycine to alanine substitution in the collagenous domain that is apparently silent in the heterozygous carriers , in 11 . 5 % of all control individuals , and in one control individual homozygous for this glycine substitution . There has been no previous finding of a glycine substitution that is not associated with any obvious phenotype in homozygous individuals .",disease
"A gene encoding a transmembrane protein is mutated in patients with diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy ( Wolfram syndrome ). Wolfram syndrome ( WFS ; OMIM 222300 ) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder defined by young - onset non - immune insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus and progressive optic atrophy . Linkage to markers on chromosome 4p was confirmed in five families . On the basis of meiotic recombinants and disease - associated haplotypes , the WFS gene was localized to a BAC / P1 contig of less than 250 kb . Mutations in a novel gene ( WFS1 ) encoding a putative transmembrane protein were found in all affected individuals in six WFS families , and these mutations were associated with the disease phenotype . WFS1 appears to function in survival of islet beta - cells and neurons ..",disease
"Molecular defects leading to human complement component C6 deficiency in an African - American family . Complement component C6 deficiency ( C6D ) was diagnosed in a 16 - year - old African - American male with meningococcal meningitis . The patients father and two brothers also had C6D , but gave no history of meningitis or other neisserial infection . By using exon - specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR )/ single - strand conformation polymorphism as a screening step and nucleotide sequencing of target exons , we determined that the proband was a compound heterozygote for two C6 gene mutations . The first , 1195delC located in exon 7 , is a novel mutation , while the second , 1936delG in exon 12 , has been described before to cause C6D in an unrelated African - American individual . Both mutations result in premature termination codons and C6 null alleles . Allele - specific PCR indicated that the probands two brothers also inherited the 1195delC mutation from their heterozygous mother and the 1936delG mutation from their homozygous father ..",disease
"Sperm DNA analysis in a Friedreich ataxia premutation carrier suggests both meiotic and mitotic expansion in the FRDA gene . Friedreich ataxia is usually caused by an expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the FRDA gene . Occasionally , a fully expanded allele has been found to arise from a premutation of 100 or less triplet repeats . We have examined the sperm DNA of a premutation carrier . This mans leucocyte DNA showed one normal allele and one allele of approximately 100 repeats . His sperm showed an expanded allele in a tight range centering on a size of approximately 320 trinucleotide repeats . His affected son has repeat sizes of 1040 and 540 . These data suggest that expansion occurs in two stages , the first during meiosis followed by a second mitotic expansion . We also show that in all informative carrier father to affected child transmissions , with the notable exception of the premutation carrier , the expansion size decreases ..",disease
"Eye movement abnormalities correlate with genotype in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I . We compared horizontal eye movements ( visually guided saccades , antisaccades , and smooth pursuit ) in control subjects ( n = 14 ) and patients with three forms of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias type I spinocerebellar ataxias 1 and 2 ( SCA1 , n = 11 ; SCA2 , n = 10 ) and SCA3 / Machado - Joseph disease ( MJD ) ( n = 16 ). In SCA1 , saccade amplitude was significantly increased , resulting in hypermetria . The smooth pursuit gain was decreased . In SCA2 , saccade velocity was markedly decreased . The percentage of errors in antisaccades was greatly increased and was significantly correlated with age at disease onset . In addition , a correlation between smooth pursuit gain and the number of trinucleotide repeats was found . In SCA3 , gaze - evoked nystagmus was often present as was saccade hypometria and smooth pursuit gain was markedly decreased . Three major criteria , saccade amplitude , saccade velocity , and presence of gaze - evoked nystagmus , permitted the correct assignment of 90 % of the SCA1 , 90 % of the SCA2 , and 93 % of the patients with SCA3 to their genetically confirmed patient group and , therefore , may help orient diagnoses of SCA1 , SCA2 , and SCA3 at early clinical stages of the diseases ..",disease
"Clustering of missense mutations in the ataxia - telangiectasia gene in a sporadic T - cell leukaemia . Ataxia - telangiectasia ( A - T ) is a recessive multi - system disorder caused by mutations in the ATM gene at 11q22 - q23 ( ref . 3 ). The risk of cancer , especially lymphoid neoplasias , is substantially elevated in A - T patients and has long been associated with chromosomal instability . By analysing tumour DNA from patients with sporadic T - cell prolymphocytic leukaemia ( T - PLL ), a rare clonal malignancy with similarities to a mature T - cell leukaemia seen in A - T , we demonstrate a high frequency of ATM mutations in T - PLL . In marked contrast to the ATM mutation pattern in A - T , the most frequent nucleotide changes in this leukaemia were missense mutations . These clustered in the region corresponding to the kinase domain , which is highly conserved in ATM - related proteins in mouse , yeast and Drosophila . The resulting amino - acid substitutions are predicted to interfere with ATP binding or substrate recognition . Two of seventeen mutated T - PLL samples had a previously reported A - T allele . In contrast , no mutations were detected in the p53 gene , suggesting that this tumour suppressor is not frequently altered in this leukaemia . Occasional missense mutations in ATM were also found in tumour DNA from patients with B - cell non - Hodgkins lymphomas ( B - NHL ) and a B - NHL cell line . The evidence of a significant proportion of loss - of - function mutations and a complete absence of the normal copy of ATM in the majority of mutated tumours establishes somatic inactivation of this gene in the pathogenesis of sporadic T - PLL and suggests that ATM acts as a tumour suppressor . As constitutional DNA was not available , a putative hereditary predisposition to T - PLL will require further investigation ..",disease
"Identification of a novel nonsense mutation and a missense substitution in the vasopressin - neurophysin II gene in two Spanish kindreds with familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus . Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( FNDI ) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by deficiency in the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) encoded by the AVP - neurophysin II ( AVP - NPII ) gene on chromosome 20p13 . In this study , we analyzed two families with FNDI using direct automated fluorescent , solid phase , single - stranded DNA sequencing of PCR - amplified AVP - NPII DNA . In one of the families , affected individuals presented a novel nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the gene , consisting in a G to T transition at nucleotide 2101 , which produces a stop signal in codon 82 ( Glu ) of NPII . The premature termination eliminates part of the C - terminal domain of NPII , including a cysteine residue in position 85 , which could be involved in the correct folding of the prohormone . In the second family , a G279A substitution at position - 1 of the signal peptide was observed in all affected individuals . This missense mutation , which replaces Ala with Thr , is frequent among FNDI patients and is thought to reduce the efficiency of cleavage by signal peptidases ..",disease
"Cloning of a novel member of the low - density lipoprotein receptor family . A gene encoding a novel transmembrane protein was identified by DNA sequence analysis within the insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus ( IDDM ) locus IDDM4 on chromosome 11q13 . Based on its chromosomal position , this gene is a candidate for conferring susceptibility to diabetes . The gene , termed low - density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5 ( LRP5 ), encodes a protein of 1615 amino acids that contains conserved modules which are characteristic of the low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor family . These modules include a putative signal peptide for protein export , four epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) repeats with associated spacer domains , three LDL - receptor ( LDLR ) repeats , a single transmembrane spanning domain , and a cytoplasmic domain . The encoded protein has a unique organization of EGF and LDLR repeats ; therefore , LRP5 likely represents a new category of the LDLR family . Both human and mouse LRP5 cDNAs have been isolated and the encoded mature proteins are 95 % identical , indicating a high degree of evolutionary conservation ..",disease
"ATM germline mutations in classical ataxia - telangiectasia patients in the Dutch population . Germline mutations in the ATM gene are responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia - telangiectasia ( A - T ). In our study , we have determined the ATM mutation spectrum in 19 classical A - T patients , including some immigrant populations , as well as 12 of Dutch ethnic origin . Both the protein truncation test ( PTT ) and the restriction endonuclease fingerprinting ( REF ) method were used and compared for their detection efficiency , identifying 76 % and 60 % of the mutations , respectively . Most patients were found to be compound heterozygote . Seventeen mutations were distinct , of which 10 were not reported previously . Mutations are small deletions or point mutations frequently affecting splice sites . Moreover , a 16 . 7 - kb genomic deletion of the 3 end of the gene , most likely a result of recombination between two LINE elements , was identified . The most frequently found mutation , identified in three unrelated Turkish A - T individuals , was previously described to be a Turkish A - T founder mutation . The presence of a founder mutation among relatively small ethnic population groups in Western Europe could indicate a high carrier frequency in such communities . In patients of Dutch ethnic origin , however , no significant founder effect could be identified . The observed genetic heterogeneity including the relative high percentage of splice - site mutations had no reflection on the phenotype . All patients manifested classical A - T and increased cellular radioresistant DNA synthesis .",disease
"Diagnosis of hemochromatosis . If untreated , hemochromatosis can cause serious illness and early death , but the disease is still substantially under - diagnosed . The cornerstone of screening and case detection is the measurement of serum transferrin saturation and the serum ferritin level . Once the diagnosis is suspected , physicians must use serum ferritin levels and hepatic iron stores on liver biopsy specimens to assess patients for the presence of iron overload . Liver biopsy is also used to establish the presence or absence of cirrhosis , which can affect prognosis and management . A DNA - based test for the HFE gene is commercially available , but its place in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis is still being evaluated . Currently , the most useful role for this test is in the detection of hemochromatosis in the family members of patients with a proven case of the disease . It is crucial to diagnose hemochromatosis before hepatic cirrhosis develops because phlebotomy therapy can avert serious chronic disease and can even lead to normal life expectancy ..",disease
"PAX6 mutations reviewed . Mutations in PAX6 are responsible for human aniridia and have also been found in patients with Peters anomaly , with congenital cataracts , with autosomal dominant keratitis , and with isolated foveal hypoplasia . No locus other than chromosome 11p13 has been implicated in aniridia , and PAX6 is clearly the major , if not only , gene responsible . Twenty - eight percent of identified PAX6 mutations are C - T changes at CpG dinucleotides , 20 % are splicing errors , and more than 30 % are deletion or insertion events . There is a noticeably elevated level of mutation in the paired domain compared with the rest of the gene . Increased mutation in the homeodomain is accounted for by the hypermutable CpG dinucleotide in codon 240 . Very nearly all mutations appear to cause loss of function of the mutant allele , and more than 80 % of exonic substitutions result in nonsense codons . In a gene with such extraordinarily high sequence conservation throughout evolution , there are presumed undiscovered missense mutations , these are hypothesized to exist in as - yet unidentified phenotypes ..",disease
"Schwartz - Jampel syndrome type 2 and Stuve - Wiedemann syndrome : a case for """""""" lumping """"""."" Recent studies demonstrated the existence of a genetically distinct , usually lethal form of the Schwartz - Jampel syndrome ( SJS ) of myotonia and skeletal dysplasia , which we called SJS type 2 . This disorder is reminiscent of another rare condition , the Stuve - Wiedemann syndrome ( SWS ), which comprises campomelia at birth with skeletal dysplasia , contractures , and early death . To test for possible nosologic identity between these disorders , we reviewed the literature and obtained a follow - up of the only two surviving patients , one with SJS type 2 at age 10 years and another with SWS at age 7 years . Patients reported as having either neonatal SJS or SWS presented a combination of a severe , prenatal - onset neuromuscular disorder ( with congenital joint contractures , respiratory and feeding difficulties , tendency to hyperthermia , and frequent death in infancy ) with a distinct campomelic - metaphyseal skeletal dysplasia . The similarity of the clinical and radiographic findings is so extensive that these disorders appear to be a single entity . The follow - up observation of an identical and unique pattern of progressive bone dysplasia in the two patients ( one with SJS type 2 , one with SWS ) surviving beyond infancy adds to the evidence in favor of identity . The hypothesis that SWS and SJS type 2 are the same disorder should be testable by molecular methods ..",disease
"The 185delAG BRCA1 mutation originated before the dispersion of Jews in the diaspora and is not limited to Ashkenazim . The 185delAG mutation in BRCA1 is detected in Ashkenazi Jews both in familial breast and ovarian cancer and in the general population . All tested Ashkenazi mutation carriers share the same allelic pattern at the BRCA1 locus . Our previous study showed that this Ashkenazi mutation also occurs in Iraqi Jews with a similar allelic pattern . We extended our analysis to other non - Ashkenazi subsets 354 of Moroccan origin , 200 Yemenites and 150 Iranian Jews . Heteroduplex analysis complemented by direct DNA sequencing of abnormally migrating bands were employed . Four of Moroccan origin ( 1 . 1 %) and none of the Yemenites or Iranians was a carrier of the 185delAG mutation . BRCA1 allelic patterns were determined for four of these individuals and for 12 additional non - Ashkenazi 185delAG mutation carriers who had breast / ovarian cancer . Six non - Ashkenazi individuals shared the common Ashkenazi haplotype , four had a closely related pattern , and the rest ( n = 6 ) displayed a distinct BRCA1 allelic pattern . We conclude that the 185delAG BRCA1 mutation occurs in some non - Ashkenazi populations at rates comparable with that of Ashkenazim . The majority of Jewish 185delAG mutation carriers have a common allelic pattern , supporting the founder effect notion , but dating the mutations origin to an earlier date than currently estimated . However , the different allelic pattern at the BRCA1 locus even in some Jewish mutation carriers , might suggest that the mutation arose independently ..",disease
"The RB1 gene mutation in a child with ectopic intracranial retinoblastoma . The RB1 gene mutation was investigated in a child with ectopic intracranial retinoblastoma using DNA obtained from both the pineal and retinal tumours of the patient . A nonsense mutation in exon 17 ( codon 556 ) of the RB1 gene was found to be present homozygously in both the retinal and the pineal tumours . The same mutation was present heterozygously in the DNA from the constitutional cells of the patient , proving it to be of germline origin . The initial mutation was shown to have occurred in the paternally derived RB1 allele .

Angelman syndrome ( AS ) is caused by chromosome 15q11 - q13 deletions of maternal origin , by paternal uniparental disomy ( UPD ) 15 , by imprinting defects , and by mutations in the UBE3A gene . UBE3A encodes a ubiquitin - protein ligase and shows brain - specific imprinting . Here we describe UBE3A coding - region mutations detected by SSCP analysis in 13 AS individuals or families . Two identical de novo 5 - bp duplications in exon 16 were found . Among the other 11 unique mutations , 8 were small deletions or insertions predicted to cause frameshifts , 1 was a mutation to a stop codon , 1 was a missense mutation , and 1 was predicted to cause insertion of an isoleucine in the hect domain of the UBE3A protein , which functions in E2 binding and ubiquitin transfer . Eight of the cases were familial , and five were sporadic . In two familial cases and one sporadic case , mosaicism for UBE3A mutations was detected in the mother of three AS sons , in the maternal grandfather of two AS first cousins , and in the mother of an AS daughter .

"Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus associated with a missense mutation encoding Gly23 --> Val in neurophysin II . Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( ADNDI ) is an inherited disease caused by progressive degeneration of the magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus leading to decreased ability to produce the hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP ). Affected individuals are not symptomatic at birth , but usually develop diabetes insipidus at 1 - 6 yr of age . The genetic locus of the disease is the AVP - neurophysin II ( NPII ) gene , and mutations that cause ADNDI have been found in both the signal peptide of the prepro - AVP - NPII precursor and within NPII itself . An affected girl who presented at 9 months of age and her similarly affected younger brother and father were all found to have a novel missense mutation ( G1758 -- > T ) encoding the amino acid substitution Gly23 -- > Val within NPII . The mutation was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis . A T1 - weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the fathers pituitary gland demonstrates an attenuated posterior pituitary bright spot . This mutation may be valuable for developing models of dominantly inherited neurodegeneration , as the early age of onset of symptoms suggests that this mutation may be particularly deleterious to the magnocellular neuron ..",disease

Very - long - chain acyl - coenzyme A dehydrogenase ( VLCAD ) deficiency is a disorder of fatty acid beta oxidation that reportedly has high rates of morbidity and mortality . We describe the outcome of a 5 - year - old girl with VLCAD deficiency who was first seen at 5 months of age with severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , hepatomegaly , encephalopathy , and hypotonia . Biochemical studies indicated VLCAD deficiency caused by a stable yet inactive enzyme . Molecular genetic analysis of her VLCAD gene revealed a T1372C ( F458L ) missense mutation and a 1668 ACAG 1669 splice site mutation . After initial treatment with intravenous glucose and carnitine , the patient has thrived on a low - fat diet supplemented with medium - chain triglyceride oil and carnitine and avoidance of fasting . Her ventricular hypertrophy resolved significantly over 1 year , and cognitively , she is in the superior range for age .

"Mutations of the ATM gene detected in Japanese ataxia - telangiectasia patients : possible preponderance of the two founder mutations 4612del165 and 7883del5 . The ATM ( A - T , mutated ) gene on human chromosome 11q22 . 3 has recently been identified as the gene responsible for the human recessive disease ataxia - telangiectasia ( A - T ). In order to define the types of disease - causing ATM mutations in Japanese A - T patients as well as to look for possible mutational hotspots , reverse - transcribed RNA derived from ten patients belonging to eight unrelated Japanese A - T families was analyzed for mutations by the restriction endonuclease fingerprinting method . As has been reported by others , mutations that lead to exon skipping or premature protein truncation were also predominant in our mutants . Six different mutations were identified on 12 of the 16 alleles examined . Four were deletions involving a loss of a single exon exon 7 , exon 16 , exon 33 or exon 35 . The others were minute deletions , 4649delA in exon 33 and 7883del5 in exon 55 . The mutations 4612del165 and 7883del5 were found in more than two unrelated families ; 44 % ( 7 of 16 ) of the mutant alleles had one of the two mutations . The 4612del165 mutations in three different families were all ascribed to the same T -- > A substitution at the splice donor site in intron 33 . Microsatellite genotyping around the ATM locus also indicated that a common haplotype was shared by the mutant alleles in both mutations . This suggests that these two founder mutations may be predominant among Japanese ATM mutant alleles .",disease
"Down - regulation of transmembrane carbonic anhydrases in renal cell carcinoma cell lines by wild - type von Hippel - Lindau transgenes . To discover genes involved in von Hippel - Lindau ( VHL ) - mediated carcinogenesis , we used renal cell carcinoma cell lines stably transfected with wild - type VHL - expressing transgenes . Large - scale RNA differential display technology applied to these cell lines identified several differentially expressed genes , including an alpha carbonic anhydrase gene , termed CA12 . The deduced protein sequence was classified as a one - pass transmembrane CA possessing an apparently intact catalytic domain in the extracellular CA module . Reintroduced wild - type VHL strongly inhibited the overexpression of the CA12 gene in the parental renal cell carcinoma cell lines . Similar results were obtained with CA9 , encoding another transmembrane CA with an intact catalytic domain . Although both domains of the VHL protein contribute to regulation of CA12 expression , the elongin binding domain alone could effectively regulate CA9 expression . We mapped CA12 and CA9 loci to chromosome bands 15q22 and 17q21 . 2 respectively , regions prone to amplification in some human cancers . Additional experiments are needed to define the role of CA IX and CA XII enzymes in the regulation of pH in the extracellular microenvironment and its potential impact on cancer cell growth .",disease
"A novel common missense mutation G301C in the N - acetylgalactosamine - 6 - sulfate sulfatase gene in mucopolysaccharidosis IVA . Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA ( MPS IVA ) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a genetic defect in N - acetylgalactosamine - 6 - sulfate sulfatase ( GALNS ). In previous studies , we have found two common mutations in Caucasians and Japanese , respectively . To characterize the mutational spectrum in various ethnic groups , mutations in the GALNS gene in Colombian MPS IVA patients were investigated , and genetic backgrounds were extensively analyzed to identify racial origin , based on mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) lineages . Three novel missense mutations never identified previously in other populations and found in 16 out of 19 Colombian MPS IVA unrelated alleles account for 84 . 2 % of the alleles in this study . The G301C and S162F mutations account for 68 . 4 % and 10 . 5 % of mutations , respectively , whereas the remaining F69V is limited to a single allele . The skewed prevalence of G301C in only Colombian patients and haplotype analysis by restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the GALNS gene suggest that G301C originated from a common ancestor . Investigation of the genetic background by means of mtDNA lineages indicate that all our patients are probably of native American descent",disease
"W474C amino acid substitution affects early processing of the alpha - subunit of beta - hexosaminidase A and is associated with subacute G ( M2 ) gangliosidosis . Mutations in the HEXA gene , encoding the alpha - subunit of beta - hexosaminidase A ( Hex A ), that abolish Hex A enzyme activity cause Tay - Sachs disease ( TSD ), the fatal infantile form of G ( M2 ) gangliosidosis , Type 1 . Less severe , subacute ( juvenile - onset ) and chronic ( adult - onset ) variants are characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and are associated with residual levels of Hex A enzyme activity . We identified a 1422 G -- > C ( amino acid W474C ) substitution in the first position of exon 13 of HEXA of a non - Jewish proband who manifested a subacute variant of G ( M2 ) gangliosidosis . On the second maternally inherited allele , we identified the common infantile disease - causing 4 - bp insertion , + TATC 1278 , in exon 11 . Pulse - chase analysis using proband fibroblasts revealed that the W474C - containing alpha - subunit precursor was normally synthesized , but not phosphorylated or secreted , and the mature lysosomal alpha - subunit was not detected . When the W474C - containing alpha - subunit was transiently co - expressed with the beta - subunit to produce Hex A ( alphabeta ) in COS - 7 cells , the mature alpha - subunit was present , but its level was much lower than that from normal alpha - subunit transfections , although higher than in those cells transfected with an alpha - subunit associated with infantile TSD . Furthermore , the precursor level of the W474C alpha - subunit was found to accumulate in comparison to the normal alpha - subunit precursor levels . We conclude that the 1422 G -- > C mutation is the cause of Hex A enzyme deficiency in the proband . The resulting W474C substitution clearly interferes with alpha - subunit processing , but because the base substitution falls at the first position of exon 13 , aberrant splicing may also contribute to Hex A deficiency in this proband ..",disease
"Myotonic dystrophy protein kinase is involved in the modulation of the Ca2 + homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells . Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ), the most prevalent muscular disorder in adults , is caused by ( CTG ) n - repeat expansion in a gene encoding a protein kinase ( DM protein kinase ; DMPK ) and involves changes in cytoarchitecture and ion homeostasis . To obtain clues to the normal biological role of DMPK in cellular ion homeostasis , we have compared the resting [ Ca2 +] i , the amplitude and shape of depolarization - induced Ca2 + transients , and the content of ATP - driven ion pumps in cultured skeletal muscle cells of wild - type and DMPK [-/-] knockout mice . In vitro - differentiated DMPK [-/-] myotubes exhibit a higher resting [ Ca2 +] i than do wild - type myotubes because of an altered open probability of voltage - dependent l - type Ca2 + and Na + channels . The mutant myotubes exhibit smaller and slower Ca2 + responses upon triggering by acetylcholine or high external K +. In addition , we observed that these Ca2 + transients partially result from an influx of extracellular Ca2 + through the l - type Ca2 + channel . Neither the content nor the activity of Na +/ K + ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + - ATPase are affected by DMPK absence . In conclusion , our data suggest that DMPK is involved in modulating the initial events of excitation - contraction coupling in skeletal muscle ..",disease
"Insertional mutation by transposable element , L1 , in the DMD gene results in X - linked dilated cardiomyopathy . X - linked dilated cardiomyopathy ( XLDCM ) is a clinical phenotype of dystrophinopathy which is characterized by preferential myocardial involvement without any overt clinical signs of skeletal myopathy . To date , several mutations in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene , DMD , have been identified in patients with XLDCM , but a pathogenic correlation of these cardiospecific mutations in DMD with the XLDCM phenotype has remained to be elucidated . We report here the identification of a unique de novo L1 insertion in the muscle exon 1 in DMD in three XLDCM patients from two unrelated Japanese families . The insertion was a 5 - truncated form of human L1 inversely integrated in the 5 - untranslated region in the muscle exon 1 , which affected the transcription or the stability of the muscle form of dystrophin transcripts but not that of the brain or Purkinje cell form , probably due to its unique site of integration . We speculate that this insertion of an L1 sequence in DMD is responsible for some of the population of Japanese patients with XLDCM ..",disease
"Genetic heterogeneity of Saethre - Chotzen syndrome , due to TWIST and FGFR mutations . Thirty - two unrelated patients with features of Saethre - Chotzen syndrome , a common autosomal dominant condition of craniosynostosis and limb anomalies , were screened for mutations in TWIST , FGFR2 , and FGFR3 . Nine novel and three recurrent TWIST mutations were found in 12 families . Seven families were found to have the FGFR3 P250R mutation , and one individual was found to have an FGFR2 VV269 - 270 deletion . To date , our detection rate for TWIST or FGFR mutations is 68 % in our Saethre - Chotzen syndrome patients , including our five patients elsewhere reported with TWIST mutations . More than 35 different TWIST mutations are now known in the literature . The most common phenotypic features , present in more than a third of our patients with TWIST mutations , are coronal synostosis , brachycephaly , low frontal hairline , facial asymmetry , ptosis , hypertelorism , broad great toes , and clinodactyly . Significant intra - and interfamilial phenotypic variability is present for either TWIST mutations or FGFR mutations . The overlap in clinical features and the presence , in the same genes , of mutations for more than one craniosynostotic condition - such as Saethre - Chotzen , Crouzon , and Pfeiffer syndromes - support the hypothesis that TWIST and FGFRs are components of the same molecular pathway involved in the modulation of craniofacial and limb development in humans ..",disease
"Frequent inactivation of PTEN / MMAC1 in primary prostate cancer . Sporadic prostate carcinoma is the most common male cancer in the Western world , yet many of the major genetic events involved in the progression of this often fatal cancer remain to be elucidated . Numerous cytogenetic and allelotype studies have reported frequent loss of heterozygosity on chromosomal arm 10q in sporadic prostate cancer . Deletion mapping studies have unambiguously identified a region of chromosome 10q23 to be the minimal area of loss . A new tumor suppressor gene , PTEN / MMAC1 , was isolated recently at this region of chromosome 10q23 and found to be inactivated by mutation in three prostate cancer cell lines . We screened 80 prostate tumors by microsatellite analysis and found chromosome 10q23 to be deleted in 23 cases . We then proceeded with sequence analysis of the entire PTEN / MMAC1 coding region and tested for homozygous deletion with new intragenic markers in these 23 cases with 10q23 loss of heterozygosity . The identification of the second mutational event in 10 ( 43 %) tumors establishes PTEN / MMAC1 as a main inactivation target of 10q loss in sporadic prostate cancer ..",disease
"Molecular heterogeneity in mucopolysaccharidosis IVA in Australia and Northern Ireland : nine novel mutations including T312S , a common allele that confers a mild phenotype . Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA ( MPS IVA ) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a genetic defect in N - acetylgalactosamine - 6 - sulfate sulfatase ( GALNS ). Previous studies of patients from a British - Irish population showed that the I113F mutation is the most common single mutation among MPS IVA patients and produces a severe clinical phenotype . We studied mutations in the GALNS gene from 23 additional MPS IVA patients ( 15 from Australia , 8 from Northern Ireland ), with various clinical phenotypes ( severe , 16 cases ; intermediate , 4 cases ; mild , 3 cases ). We found two common mutations that together accounted for 32 % of the 44 unrelated alleles in these patients . One is the T312S mutation , a novel mutation found exclusively in milder patients . The other is the previously described I113F that produces a severe phenotype . The I113F and T312S mutations accounted for 8 ( 18 %) and 6 ( 14 %) of 44 unrelated alleles , respectively . The relatively high residual GALNS activity seen when the T312S mutant cDNA is overexpressed in mutant cells provides an explanation for the mild phenotype in patients with this mutation . The distribution and relative frequencies of the I113F and T312S mutations in Australia corresponded to those observed in Northern Ireland and are unique to these two populations , suggesting that both mutations were probably introduced to Australia by Irish migrants during the 19th century . Haplotype analysis using 6 RFLPs provides additional data that the I113F mutation originated from a common ancestor . The other 9 novel mutations identified in these 23 patients were each limited to a single family . These data provide further evidence for extensive allelic heterogeneity in MPS IVA in British - Irish patients and provide evidence for their transmission to Australia by British - Irish migrants ..",disease
"Further evidence for a major ancient mutation underlying myotonic dystrophy from linkage disequilibrium studies in the Japanese population . The myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) mutation is an unstable ( CTG ) n repeat , present at a copy number of 5 - 37 repeats on normal chromosomes but amplified to 50 - 3000 copies on DM chromosomes . Previous findings in Caucasian populations of a DM founder chromosome raise a question about the molecular events involved in the expansion mutation . To investigate whether a founder chromosome for the DM mutation exists in the Japanese population , we genotyped families using polymorphic markers near the ( CTG ) n repeat region and constructed haplotypes . Six different haplotypes were found and DM alleles were always haplotype A . To find an origin of the ( CTG ) n repeat mutation and to investigate the mechanism of the expansion mutation in the Japanese population we have studied 90 Japanese DM families comprising 190 affected and 130 unaffected members . The results suggest that a few common ancestral mutations in both Caucasian and Japanese populations have originated by expansion of an ancestral n = 5 repeat to n = 19 - 37 copies . These data support multistep models of triplet repeat expansion that have been proposed for both DM and Friedreichs ataxia ..",disease
"Prevalence of p16 and CDK4 germline mutations in 48 melanoma - prone families in France . The French Familial Melanoma Study Group . Germline mutations in the p16 and CDK4 genes have been reported in a subset of melanoma pedigrees , but their prevalence is not well known . We searched for such germline mutations in 48 French melanoma - prone families selected according to two major criteria families with at least three affected members ( n = 20 ) or families with two affected members , one of them affected before the age of 50 ( n = 28 ), and one additional minor criterion . Sixteen different p16 germline mutations were found in 21 families , while one germline mutation , Arg24His , was detected in the CDK4 gene . The frequency of p16 gene mutation in our sample ( 44 %) is among the highest rates yet reported and the CDK4 mutation is the second mutation detected in this gene worldwide . In summary , our results show frequent involvement of the p16 gene in familial melanoma and confirm the role of the CDK4 gene as a melanoma - predisposing gene ..",disease
"Systematic analysis of coproporphyrinogen oxidase gene defects in hereditary coproporphyria and mutation update . Hereditary coproporphyria ( HC ) is an acute hepatic porphyria with autosomal dominant inheritance caused by deficient activity of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase ( CPO ). Clinical manifestations of the disease are characterized by acute attacks of neurological dysfunction often precipitated by drugs , fasting , cyclical hormonal changes , or infectious diseases . Skin photosensitivity may also be present . The seven exons , the exon / intron boundaries and part of 3 noncoding sequence of the CPO gene were systematically analyzed by an exon - by - exon denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE ) strategy followed by direct sequencing in seven unrelated heterozygous HC patients from France , Holland , and Czech Republic . Seven novel mutations and two new polymorphisms were detected . Among these mutations two are missense ( G197W , W427R ), two are nonsense ( Q306X , Q385X ), two are small deletions ( 662de14bp ; 1168del3bp removing a glycine at position 390 ), and one is a splicing mutation ( IVS1 - 15c -- > g ) which creates a new acceptor splice site . The pathological significance of the point mutations G197W , W427R , and the in - frame deletion 390delGly were assessed by their respective expression in a prokaryotic system using site - directed mutagenesis . These mutations resulted in the absence or a dramatic decrease of CPO activity . The two polymorphisms were localized in noncoding part of the gene 1 ) a C / G polymorphism in the promotor region , 142 bp upstream from the transcriptional initiation site (- 142C / G ), and 2 ) a 6 bp deletion polymorphism in the 3 noncoding part of the CPO gene , 574 bp downstream of the last base of the normal termination codon (+ 574 delATTCTT ). Five intragenic dimorphisms are now well characterized and the high degree of allelic heterogeneity in HC is demonstrated",disease

"The haptoglobin - gene deletion responsible for anhaptoglobinemia . We have found an allelic deletion of the haptoglobin ( Hp ) gene from an individual with anhaptoglobinemia . The Hp gene cluster consists of coding regions of the alpha chain and beta chain of the haptoglobin gene ( Hp ) and of the alpha chain and beta chain of the haptoglobin - related gene ( Hpr ), in tandem from the 5 side . Southern blot and PCR analyses have indicated that the individual with anhaptoglobinemia was homozygous for the gene deletion and that the gene deletion was included at least from the promoter region of Hp to Hpr alpha but not to Hpr beta ( Hpdel ). In addition , we found seven individuals with hypohaptoglobinemia in three families , and the genotypes of six of the seven individuals were found to be Hp2 / Hpdel . The phenotypes and genotypes in one of these three families showed the father to be hypohaptoglobinemic ( Hp2 ) and Hp2 / Hpdel , the mother to be Hp2 - 1 and Hp1 / Hp2 , one of the two children to be hypohaptoglobinemic ( Hp2 ) and Hp2 / Hpdel , and the other child to be Hp1 and Hp1 / Hpdel , showing an anomalous inheritance of Hp phenotypes in the child with Hp1 . The Hp2 / Hpdel individuals had an extremely low level of Hp ( mean +/- SD = 0 . 049 +/- 0 . 043 mg / ml ; n = 6 ), compared with the level ( 1 . 64 +/- 1 . 07 mg / ml ) obtained from 52 healthy volunteers having phenotype Hp2 , whereas the serum Hp level of an individual with Hp1 / Hpdel was 0 . 50 mg / ml , which was approximately half the level of Hp in control sera from the Hp1 phenotype ( 1 . 26 +/- 0 . 33 mg / ml ; n = 9 ), showing a gene - dosage effect .",disease

However , the mechanism of hypohaptoglobinemia remains unknown",disease
"Genotype - phenotype correlations in attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli . Germ - line mutations of the tumor suppressor APC are implicated in attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli ( AAPC ), a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ). AAPC is recognized by the occurrence of < 100 colonic adenomas and a later onset of colorectal cancer ( age > 40 years ). The aim of this study was to assess genotype - phenotype correlations in AAPC families . By protein - truncation test ( PTT ) assay , the entire coding region of the APC gene was screened in affected individuals from 11 AAPC kindreds , and their phenotypic differences were examined . Five novel germ - line APC mutations were identified in seven kindreds . Mutations were located in three different regions of the APC gene ( 1 ) at the 5 end spanning exons 4 and 5 , ( 2 ) within exon 9 , and ( 3 ) at the 3 distal end of the gene . Variability in the number of colorectal adenomas was most apparent in individuals with mutations in region 1 , and upper - gastrointestinal manifestations were more severe in them . In individuals with mutations in either region 2 or region 3 , the average number of adenomas tended to be lower than those in individuals with mutations in region 1 , although age at diagnosis was similar . In all AAPC kindreds , a predominance of right - sided colorectal adenomas and rectal polyp sparing was observed . No desmoid tumors were found in these kindreds . Our data suggest that , in AAPC families , the location of the APC mutation may partially predict specific phenotypic expression . This should help in the design of tailored clinical - management protocols in this subset of FAP patients ..",disease
"The APC variants I1307K and E1317Q are associated with colorectal tumors , but not always with a family history . Classical familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is a high - penetrance autosomal dominant disease that predisposes to hundreds or thousands of colorectal adenomas and carcinoma and that results from truncating mutations in the APC gene . A variant of FAP is attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli , which results from germ - line mutations in the 5 and 3 regions of the APC gene . Attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli patients have """""""" multiple """""""" colorectal adenomas ( typically fewer than 100 ) without the florid phenotype of classical FAP . Another group of patients with multiple adenomas has no mutations in the APC gene , and their phenotype probably results from variation at a locus , or loci , elsewhere in the genome . Recently , however , a missense variant of APC ( I1307K ) was described that confers an increased risk of colorectal tumors , including multiple adenomas , in Ashkenazim . We have studied a set of 164 patients with multiple colorectal adenomas and / or carcinoma and analyzed codons 1263 - 1377 ( exon 15G ) of the APC gene for germ - line variants . Three patients with the I1307K allele were detected , each of Ashkenazi descent . Four patients had a germ - line E1317Q missense variant of APC that was not present in controls ; one of these individuals had an unusually large number of metaplastic polyps of the colorectum . There is increasing evidence that there exist germ - line variants of the APC gene that predispose to the development of multiple colorectal adenomas and carcinoma , but without the florid phenotype of classical FAP , and possibly with importance for colorectal cancer risk in the general population ..",disease
"The hemochromatosis 845 G --> A and 187 C --> G mutations : prevalence in non - Caucasian populations . Hemochromatosis , the inherited disorder of iron metabolism , leads , if untreated , to progressive iron overload and premature death . The hemochromatosis gene , HFE , recently has been identified , and characterization of this gene has shown that it contains two mutations that result in amino acid substitutions - cDNA nucleotides 845 G -- > A ( C282Y ) and 187 C -- > G ( H63D ). Although hemochromatosis is common in Caucasians , affecting > = 1 / 300 individuals of northern European origin , it has not been recognized in other populations . The present study used PCR and restriction - enzyme digestion to analyze the frequency of the 845 G -- > A and 187 C -- > G mutations in HLA - typed samples from non - Caucasian populations , comprising Australian Aboriginal , Chinese , and Pacific Islanders . Results showed that the 845 G -- > A mutation was present in these populations ( allele frequency 0 . 32 %), and , furthermore , it was always seen in conjunction with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians , suggesting that 845 G -- > A may have been introduced into these populations by Caucasian admixture . 187 C -- > G was present at an allele frequency of 2 . 68 % in the two populations analyzed ( Australian Aboriginal and Chinese ). In the Australian Aboriginal samples , 187 C -- > G was found to be associated with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians , suggesting that it was introduced by recent admixture . In the Chinese samples analyzed , 187 C -- > G was present in association with a wide variety of HLA haplotypes , showing this mutation to be widespread and likely to predate the more genetically restricted 845 G -- > A mutation .",disease
"BRCA1 required for transcription - coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage . The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 encodes a zinc finger protein of unknown function . Association of the BRCA1 protein with the DNA repair protein Rad51 and changes in the phosphorylation and cellular localization of the protein after exposure to DNA - damaging agents are consistent with a role for BRCA1 in DNA repair . Here , it is shown that mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in BRCA1 are defective in the ability to carry out transcription - coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage , and are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and hydrogen peroxide . These results suggest that BRCA1 participates , directly or indirectly , in transcription - coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage ..",disease
"A mouse model of severe von Willebrand disease : defects in hemostasis and thrombosis . von Willebrand factor ( vWf ) deficiency causes severe von Willebrand disease in humans . We generated a mouse model for this disease by using gene targeting . vWf - deficient mice appeared normal at birth ; they were viable and fertile . Neither vWf nor vWf propolypeptide ( von Willebrand antigen II ) were detectable in plasma , platelets , or endothelial cells of the homozygous mutant mice . The mutant mice exhibited defects in hemostasis with a highly prolonged bleeding time and spontaneous bleeding events in approximately 10 % of neonates . As in the human disease , the factor VIII level in these mice was reduced strongly as a result of the lack of protection provided by vWf . Defective thrombosis in mutant mice was also evident in an in vivo model of vascular injury . In this model , the exteriorized mesentery was superfused with ferric chloride and the accumulation of fluorescently labeled platelets was observed by intravital microscopy . We conclude that these mice very closely mimic severe human von Willebrand disease and will be very useful for investigating the role of vWf in normal physiology and in disease models ..",disease
"The von Hippel - Lindau tumor suppressor gene is required for cell cycle exit upon serum withdrawal . The inactivation of the von Hippel - Lindau ( VHL ) tumor suppressor gene predisposes affected individuals to the human VHL cancer syndrome and is associated with sporadic renal cell carcinomas ( RCC ) and brain hemangioblastomas . VHL - negative 786 - 0 RCC cells are tumorigenic in nude mice which is suppressed by the reintroduction of VHL . Remarkably , this occurs without affecting the growth rate and cell cycle profile of these cells in culture . The 786 - 0 cell line , like many cancer cells , fails to exit the cell cycle upon serum withdrawal . Here , it is shown that reintroduction of the wild - type VHL gene restores the ability of VHL - negative RCC cancer cells to exit the cell cycle and enter G0 / quiescence in low serum . Both VHL - positive and VHL - negative RCC cells exit the cell cycle by contact inhibition . The cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor , p27 , accumulates upon serum withdrawal , only in the presence of VHL , as a result of the stabilization of the protein . We propose that the loss of wild - type VHL gene results in a specific cellular defect in serum - dependent growth control , which may initiate tumor formation . This is corrected by the reintroduction of wild - type VHL , implicating VHL as the first tumor suppressor involved in the regulation of cell cycle exit , which is consistent with its gatekeeper function in the kidney ..",disease
Nonsense mutation in exon 4 of human complement C9 gene is the major cause of Japanese complement C9 deficiency . Deficiency of the ninth component of human complement ( C9 ) is the most common complement deficiency in Japan but is rare in other countries . We studied the molecular basis of C9 deficiency in four Japanese C9 - deficient patients who had suffered from meningococcal meningitis . Direct sequencing of amplified C9 cDNA and DNA revealed a nonsense substitution ( CGA -- > TGA ) at codon 95 in exon 4 in the four C9 - deficient individuals . An allele - specific polymerase chain reaction system designed to detect exclusively only one of the normal and mutant alleles indicated that all the four patients were homozygous for the mutation in exon 4 and that the parents of patient 2 were heterozygous . The common mutation at codon 95 in exon 4 might be responsible for most Japanese C9 deficiency ..,disease
"Human complement factor H deficiency associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome . This study reports on six cases of deficiency in the human complement regulatory protein Factor H ( FH ) in the context of an acute renal disease . Five of the cases were observed in children presenting with idiopathic hemolytic uremic syndrome ( HUS ). Two of the children exhibited a homozygous deficiency characterized by the absence of the 150 - kD form of Factor H and the presence , upon immunoblotting , of the 42 - kD Factor H - like protein 1 ( FHL - 1 ) and other FH - related protein ( FHR ) bands . Southern blot and PCR analysis of DNA of one patient with homozygous deficiency ruled out the presence of a large deletion of the FH gene as the underlying defect for the deficiency . The other four children presented with heterozygous deficiency and exhibited a normal immunoblotting pattern of proteins of the FH family . Factor H deficiency is the only complement deficiency associated with HUS . These observations suggest a role for FH and / or FH receptors in the pathogenesis of idiopathic HUS ..",disease
"Cell cycle - dependent colocalization of BARD1 and BRCA1 proteins in discrete nuclear domains . Germ - line mutations of the BRCA1 gene predispose women to early - onset breast and ovarian cancer by compromising the genes presumptive function as a tumor suppressor . Although the biochemical properties of BRCA1 polypeptides are not understood , their expression pattern and subcellular localization suggest a role in cell - cycle regulation . When resting cells are induced to proliferate , the steady - state levels of BRCA1 increase in late G1 and reach a maximum during S phase . Moreover , in S phase cells , BRCA1 polypeptides are hyperphosphorylated and accumulate into discrete subnuclear foci termed """""""" BRCA1 nuclear dots . """""""" BRCA1 associates in vivo with a structurally related protein termed BARD1 . Here we show that the steady - state levels of BARD1 , unlike those of BRCA1 , remain relatively constant during cell cycle progression . However , immunostaining revealed that BARD1 resides within BRCA1 nuclear dots during S phase of the cell cycle , but not during the G1 phase . Nevertheless , BARD1 polypeptides are found exclusively in the nuclear fractions of both G1 - and S - phase cells . Therefore , progression to S phase is accompanied by the aggregation of nuclear BARD1 polypeptides into BRCA1 nuclear dots . This cell cycle - dependent colocalization of BARD1 and BRCA1 indicates a role for BARD1 in BRCA1 - mediated tumor suppression .",disease
"Genetic basis and molecular mechanism for idiopathic ventricular fibrillation . Ventricular fibrillation causes more than 300 , 000 sudden deaths each year in the USA alone . In approximately 5 - 12 % of these cases , there are no demonstrable cardiac or non - cardiac causes to account for the episode , which is therefore classified as idiopathic ventricular fibrillation ( IVF ). A distinct group of IVF patients has been found to present with a characteristic electrocardiographic pattern . Because of the small size of most pedigrees and the high incidence of sudden death , however , molecular genetic studies of IVF have not yet been done . Because IVF causes cardiac rhythm disturbance , we investigated whether malfunction of ion channels could cause the disorder by studying mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A . We have now identified a missense mutation , a splice - donor mutation , and a frameshift mutation in the coding region of SCN5A in three IVF families . We show that sodium channels with the missense mutation recover from inactivation more rapidly than normal and that the frameshift mutation causes the sodium channel to be non - functional . Our results indicate that mutations in cardiac ion - channel genes contribute to the risk of developing IVF ..",disease
"Prevalence of the I1307K APC gene variant in Israeli Jews of differing ethnic origin and risk for colorectal cancer . BACKGROUND & AIMS Israeli Jews of European birth , i . e ., Ashkenazim , have the highest colorectal cancer incidence of any Israeli ethnic group . The I1307K APC gene variant was found in 6 . 1 % of American Jews , 28 % of their familial colorectal cancer cases , but not in non - Jews . We assessed the I1307K prevalence in Israeli Jews of differing ethnic origin and risk for colorectal cancer . METHODS DNA samples from 500 unrelated Jews of European or non - European origin , with or without a personal and / or family history of neoplasia , were examined for the I1307K variant by the allele - specific oligonucleotide ( ASO ) method . RESULTS In persons at average risk for colorectal cancer , I1307K was found in 5 . 0 % of 120 European and 1 . 6 % of 188 non - European Jews ( P = 0 . 08 ). It occurred in 15 . 4 % of 52 Ashkenazi Israelis with familial cancer ( P = 0 . 02 ) and was not detected in 51 non - European Jews at increased cancer risk . Colorectal neoplasia occurred personally or in the families of 13 of 20 Ashkenazi I1307K carriers , 8 of whom also had a personal or family history of noncolonic neoplasia . CONCLUSIONS The I1307K APC variant may represent a susceptibility gene for colorectal , or other , cancers in Ashkenazi Jews , and partially explains the higher incidence of colorectal cancer in European Israelis .",disease
"Susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis in twins : the role of genes , HLA , and the environment . OBJECTIVE To determine the relative effects of genetic and environmental factors in susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ). METHODS Twins with AS were identified from the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases database . Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed to establish diagnoses , and disease severity was assessed using a combination of validated scoring systems . HLA typing for HLA - B27 , HLA - B60 , and HLA - DR1 was performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence - specific primers , and zygosity was assessed using microsatellite markers . Genetic and environmental variance components were assessed with the program Mx , using data from this and previous studies of twins with AS . RESULTS Six of 8 monozygotic ( MZ ) twin pairs were disease concordant , compared with 4 of 15 B27 - positive dizygotic ( DZ ) twin pairs ( 27 %) and 4 of 32 DZ twin pairs overall ( 12 . 5 %). Nonsignificant increases in similarity with regard to age at disease onset and all of the disease severity scores assessed were noted in disease - concordant MZ twins compared with concordant DZ twins . HLA - B27 and B60 were associated with the disease in probands , and the rate of disease concordance was significantly increased among DZ twin pairs in which the co - twin was positive for both B27 and DR1 . Additive genetic effects were estimated to contribute 97 % of the population variance . CONCLUSION Susceptibility to AS is largely genetically determined , and the environmental trigger for the disease is probably ubiquitous . HLA - B27 accounts for a minority of the overall genetic susceptibility to AS .",disease
"The APCI1307K allele and cancer risk in a community - based study of Ashkenazi Jews . Mutations in APC are classically associated with familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ), a highly penetrant autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple intestinal polyps and , without surgical intervention , the development of colorectal cancer ( CRC ). APC is a tumour - suppressor gene , and somatic loss occurs in tumours . The germline T - to - A transversion responsible for the APC I1307K allele converts the wild - type sequence to a homopolymer tract ( A8 ) that is genetically unstable and prone to somatic mutation . The I1307K allele was found in 6 . 1 % of unselected Ashkenazi Jews and higher proportions of Ashkenazim with family or personal histories of CRC ( ref . 2 ). To evaluate the role of I1307K in cancer , we genotyped 5 , 081 Ashkenazi volunteers in a community survey . Risk of developing colorectal , breast and other cancers were compared between genotyped I1307K carriers and non - carriers and their first - degree relatives .",disease
"The hemochromatosis gene product complexes with the transferrin receptor and lowers its affinity for ligand binding . We recently reported the positional cloning of a candidate gene for hereditary hemochromatosis called HFE . The gene product , a member of the major histocompatibility complex class I - like family , was found to have a mutation , Cys - 282 -- > Tyr ( C282Y ), in 85 % of patient chromosomes . This mutation eliminates the ability of HFE to associate with beta2 - microglobulin ( beta2m ) and prevents cell - surface expression . A second mutation that has no effect on beta2m association , H63D , was found in eight out of nine patients heterozygous for the C282Y mutant . In this report , we demonstrate in cultured 293 cells overexpressing wild - type or mutant HFE proteins that both the wild - type and H63D HFE proteins form stable complexes with the transferrin receptor ( TfR ). The C282Y mutation nearly completely prevents the association of the mutant HFE protein with the TfR . Studies on cell - associated transferrin at 37 degrees C suggest that the overexpressed wild - type HFE protein decreases the affinity of the TfR for transferrin . The overexpressed H63D protein does not have this effect , providing the first direct evidence for a functional consequence of the H63D mutation . Addition of soluble wild - type HFE / beta2m heterodimers to cultured cells also decreased the apparent affinity of the TfR for its ligand under steady - state conditions , both in 293 cells and in HeLa cells . Furthermore , at 4 degrees C , the added soluble complex of HFE / beta2m inhibited binding of transferrin to HeLa cell TfR in a concentration - dependent manner . Scatchard plots of these data indicate that the added heterodimer substantially reduced the affinity of TfR for transferrin . These results establish a molecular link between HFE and a key protein involved in iron transport , the TfR , and raise the possibility that alterations in this regulatory mechanism may play a role in the pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis ..",disease
"Cycloheximide facilitates the identification of aberrant transcripts resulting from a novel splice - site mutation in COL17A1 in a patient with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa . Patients with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa often show decreased expression of type XVII collagen , a transmembrane hemidesmosomal protein encoded by COL17A1 . This report documents a novel splice - site mutation in COL17A1 in a patient with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa , and applies a new methodology to define and characterize the resulting mRNA splice variants . Mutational analysis of COL17A1 identified a maternally inherited G - to - T transversion at the - 1 position of exon 32 . This acceptor splice - site mutation led to the formation of aberrant transcripts present at extremely low levels . Based on our recent finding that cycloheximide stabilized mutant COL17A1 transcripts in keratinocytes homozygous for a frameshift mutation , the effects of the splice - site mutation on splicing of COL17A1 transcripts were determined using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of total RNA from keratinocytes incubated for 2 . 5 h in the presence or absence of 10 microg cycloheximide per ml . Using this approach , an abnormally spliced transcript was identified that contains an extra 264 bases upstream from exon 32 , resulting in a premature termination codon 27 bp downstream from the cryptic splice site . Three other splice variants , including one derived from the skipping of exon 32 , were also identified . These results indicate the usefulness of cycloheximide treatment in evaluating the abnormal processing of mRNA due to splice - site mutations , because ( i ) aberrant splicing often generates a premature termination codon , ( ii ) transcripts with premature termination codons can occur at low or undetectable levels due to nonsense - mediated mRNA decay , and ( iii ) the levels of these transcripts can be increased by cycloheximide .",disease
"The DMPK gene of severely affected myotonic dystrophy patients is hypermethylated proximal to the largely expanded CTG repeat . Using methylation - sensitive restriction enzymes , we characterized the methylation pattern on the 5 side of the CTG repeat in the DMPK gene of normal individuals and of patients affected with myotonic dystrophy , showing expansions of the repetitive sequence . The gene segment analyzed corresponds to the genomic SacI - HindIII fragment carrying exons 11 - 15 . There is constitutive methylation in intron 12 at restriction sites of SacII and HhaI , localized 1 , 159 - 1 , 232 bp upstream of the CTG repeat , whereas most , if not all , of the other sites of SacII , HhaI , and HpaII in this region are unmethylated , in normal individuals and most of the patients . In a number of young and severely affected patients , however , complete methylation of these restriction sites was found in the mutated allele . In most of these patients , the onset of the disease was congenital . Preliminary in vivo footprinting data gave evidence for protein - DNA contact in normal genes at an Sp1 consensus binding site upstream of the CTG repeat and for a significant reduction of this interaction in cells with a hypermethylated DMPK gene ..",disease
"Progression of somatic CTG repeat length heterogeneity in the blood cells of myotonic dystrophy patients . The genetic basis of myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is the expansion of an unstable CTG repeat in the 34 UTR of the DM protein kinase gene on chromosome 19 . One of the principal features of the DM mutation is an extraordinarily high level of somatic mosaicism , due to an extremely high degree of somatic instability both within and between different tissues . This instability appears to be biased towards further expansion and continuous throughout the life of an individual , features that could be associated with the progressive nature of the disease . Although increasing measured allele size between patients clearly correlates with an increased severity of symptoms and an earlier age of onset , this correlation is not precise and measured allele length cannot be used as an accurate predictor of age of onset . In order to further characterize the dynamics of DM CTG repeat somatic instability , we have studied repeat length changes over time in 111 myotonic dystrophy patients with varying clinical severity and CTG repeat size over time intervals of 1 - 7 years . We have found a direct progression of the size heterogeneity over time related to initial CTG repeat size and the time interval and always biased towards further expansion . Attempts to mathematically model the dynamics have proved only partially successful suggesting that individual specific genetic and / or environmental factors also play a role in somatic mosaicism ..",disease
"Inherited colorectal polyposis and cancer risk of the APC I1307K polymorphism . Germ - line and somatic truncating mutations of the APC gene are thought to initiate colorectal tumor formation in familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome and sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis , respectively . Recently , an isoleucine -- > lysine polymorphism at codon 1307 ( I1307K ) of the APC gene has been identified in 6 % - 7 % of the Ashkenazi Jewish population . To assess the risk of this common APC allelic variant in colorectal carcinogenesis , we have analyzed a large cohort of unselected Ashkenazi Jewish subjects with adenomatous polyps and . or colorectal cancer , for the APC I1307K polymorphism . The APC I1307K allele was identified in 48 ( 10 . 1 %) of 476 patients . Compared with the frequency in two separate population control groups , the APC I1307K allele is associated with an estimated relative risk of 1 . 5 - 1 . 7 for colorectal neoplasia ( both P =. 01 ). Furthermore , compared with noncarriers , APC I1307K carriers had increased numbers of adenomas and colorectal cancers per patient ( P =. 03 ), as well as a younger age at diagnosis . We conclude that the APC I1307K variant leads to increased adenoma formation and directly contributes to 3 % - 4 % of all Ashkenazi Jewish colorectal cancer . The estimated relative risk for carriers may justify specific clinical screening for the 360 , 000 Americans expected to harbor this allele , and genetic testing in the setting of long - term - outcome studies may impact significantly on colorectal cancer prevention in this population .",disease

"Are Dp71 and Dp140 brain dystrophin isoforms related to cognitive impairment in Duchenne muscular dystrophy ? Molecular study and neuropsychological analysis were performed concurrently on 49 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) in order to find a molecular explanation for the cognitive impairment observed in most DMD patients . Complete analysis of the dystrophin gene was performed to define the localization of deletions and duplications in relation to the different DMD promoters . Qualitative analysis of the Dp71 transcript and testing for the specific first exon of Dp140 were also carried out . Neuropsychological analysis assessed verbal and visuospatial intelligence , verbal memory , and reading skills . Comparison of molecular and psychometric findings demonstrated that deletions and duplications that were localized in the distal part of the gene seemed to be preferentially associated with cognitive impairment . Two altered Dp71 transcripts and two deleted Dp140 DNA sequences were found in four patients with severe cerebral dysfunction . These findings suggest that some sequences located in the distal part of the gene and , in particular , some DMD isoforms expressed in the brain may be related to the cognitive impairment associated with DMD ..",disease
"A genome - wide search for chromosomal loci linked to mental health wellness in relatives at high risk for bipolar affective disorder among the Old Order Amish . Bipolar affective disorder ( BPAD ; manic - depressive illness ) is characterized by episodes of mania and / or hypomania interspersed with periods of depression .

To date , however , linkage studies have attempted only to identify chromosomal loci that cause or increase the risk of developing BPAD . To determine whether there could be protective alleles that prevent or reduce the risk of developing BPAD , similar to what is observed in other genetic disorders , we used mental health wellness ( absence of any psychiatric disorder ) as the phenotype in our genome - wide linkage scan of several large multigeneration Old Order Amish pedigrees exhibiting an extremely high incidence of BPAD . We have found strong evidence for a locus on chromosome 4p at D4S2949 ( maximum GENEHUNTER - PLUS nonparametric linkage score = 4 . 05 , P = 5 . 22 x 10 (- 4 ); SIBPAL Pempirical value < 3 x 10 (- 5 )) and suggestive evidence for a locus on chromosome 4q at D4S397 ( maximum GENEHUNTER - PLUS nonparametric linkage score = 3 . 29 , P = 2 . 57 x 10 (- 3 ); SIBPAL Pempirical value < 1 x 10 (- 3 )) that are linked to mental health wellness . These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that certain alleles could prevent or modify the clinical manifestations of BPAD and perhaps other related affective disorders .",disease
"Hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement in man . I . Clinical , immunochemical , and family studies . The first recognized human kindred with hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement ( C5 ) is described . The proband , a 20 - year - old black female with systemic lupus erythematosus since age 11 , lacked serum hemolytic complement activity , even during remission . C5 was undetectable in her serum by both immunodiffusion and hemolytic assays . Other complement components were normal during remission of lupus , but C1 , C4 , C2 , and C3 levels fell during exacerbations . A younger half - sister , who had no underlying disease , was also found to lack immunochemically detectable C5 . By hemolytic assay , she exhibited 1 - 2 % of the normal serum C5 level and normal concentrations of other complement components . C5 levels of other family members were either normal or approximately half - normal , consistent with autosomal codominant inheritance of the gene determining C5 deficiency . Normal hemolytic titers were restored to both homozygous C5 - deficient ( C5D ) sera by addition of highly purified human C5 . In specific C5 titrations , however , it was noted that when limited amounts of C5 were assayed in the presence of low dilutions of either C5D serum , curving rather than linear dose - response plots were consistently obtained , suggesting some inhibitory effect . Further studies suggested that low dilutions of C5D serum contain a factor ( or factors ) interfering at some step in the hemolytic assay of C5 , rather than a true C5 inhibitor or inactivator . Of clinical interest are ( a ) the documentation of membranous glomerulonephritis , vasculitis , and arthritis in an individual lacking C5 ( and its biologic functions ), and ( b ) a remarkable propensity to bacterial infections in the proband , even during periods of low - dose or alternate - day corticosteroid therapy . Other observations indicate that the C5D state is compatible with normal coagulation function and the capacity to mount a neutrophilic leukocytosis during pyogenic infection ..",disease
"Detection of heterozygous carriers of the ataxia - telangiectasia ( ATM ) gene by G2 phase chromosomal radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes . In ataxia - telangiectasia ( A - T ) patients , mutations in a single gene , ATM , result in an autosomal recessive syndrome that embraces a variety of clinical features and manifests extreme radiosensitivity and a strong pre - disposition to malignancy . Heterozygotes for the ATM gene have no clinical expression of A - T but may be cancer prone with a moderate increase in in vitro radiosensitivity . We performed a blind chromosomal analysis on G2 - phase lymphocytes from 7 unrelated A - T patients , 13 obligate A - T heterozygotes ( parents of the patients ), and 14 normal controls following X - irradiation with 1 Gy in order to evaluate this cytogenetic method as a tool for detection of ATM carriers . Both A - T homozygotes and heterozygotes showed significantly increased levels of radiation - induced chromatid damage relative to that of normal controls . These results show that the G2 - phase chromosomal radiosensitivity assay can be used for the detection of A - T heterozygotes . In combination with molecular genetic analyses , this test may be of value in studies of familial and sporadic cancers aimed at determination of the potential involvement of ATM mutations in tumor risk or development ..",disease
"The molecular basis of C6 deficiency in the western Cape , South Africa . Deficiency of the sixth component of human complement ( C6 ) has been reported in a number of families from the western Cape , South Africa . Meningococcal disease is endemic in the Cape and almost all pedigrees of total C6 deficiency ( C6Q0 ) have been ascertained because of recurrent disease . We have sequenced the expressed exons of the C6 gene from selected cases and have found three molecular defects leading to total deficiency 879delG , which is the common defect in the Cape and hitherto unreported , and 1195delC and 1936delG , which have been previously reported in African - Americans . We also show that the 879delG and 1195delC defects are associated with characteristic C6 / C7 region DNA marker haplotypes , although small variations were observed . The 1936delG defect was observed only once in the Cape , but its associated haplotype could be deduced . The data from the haplotypes indicate that these three molecular defects account for the defects in all the 38 unrelated C6Q0 individuals we have studied from the Cape . We have also observed the 879delG defect in two Dutch C6 - deficient kindreds , but the 879delG defect in the Cape probably did not come from The Netherlands ..",disease
"The R496H mutation of arylsulfatase A does not cause metachromatic leukodystrophy . Deficiency of arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ) enzyme activity causes metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ). A number of ARSA gene mutations responsible for MLD have been identified . Recently , the R496H mutation of ARSA was proposed to be a cause of MLD ( Draghia et al ., 1997 ). We have investigated the R496H mutation and found this mutation at a relatively high frequency in an African American population ( f = 0 . 09 , n = 61 subjects ). The ARSA enzyme activity in subjects with and without the R496H mutation was determined and found to be normal . It is therefore concluded that the R496H mutation of ARSA does not negatively influence the activity of ARSA and is not a cause of MLD",disease
"Piebaldism with deafness : molecular evidence for an expanded syndrome . In a South African girl of Xhosa stock with severe piebaldism and profound congenital sensorineural deafness we identified a novel missense substitution at a highly conserved residue in the intracellular kinase domain of the KIT proto - oncogene , R796G . Though auditory anomalies have been observed in mice with dominant white spotting ( W ) due to KIT mutations , deafness is not typical in human piebaldism . Thus , the occurrence of sensorineural deafness in this patient extends considerably the phenotypic range of piebaldism due to KIT gene mutation in humans and tightens the clinical similarity between piebaldism and the various forms of Waardenburg syndrome ..",disease
"Genetic heterogeneity and penetrance analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in breast cancer families . The Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium . The contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to inherited breast cancer was assessed by linkage and mutation analysis in 237 families , each with at least four cases of breast cancer , collected by the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium . Families were included without regard to the occurrence of ovarian or other cancers . Overall , disease was linked to BRCA1 in an estimated 52 % of families , to BRCA2 in 32 % of families , and to neither gene in 16 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 6 % - 28 %), suggesting other predisposition genes . The majority ( 81 %) of the breast - ovarian cancer families were due to BRCA1 , with most others ( 14 %) due to BRCA2 . Conversely , the majority of families with male and female breast cancer were due to BRCA2 ( 76 %). The largest proportion ( 67 %) of families due to other genes was found in families with four or five cases of female breast cancer only . These estimates were not substantially affected either by changing the assumed penetrance model for BRCA1 or by including or excluding BRCA1 mutation data . Among those families with disease due to BRCA1 that were tested by one of the standard screening methods , mutations were detected in the coding sequence or splice sites in an estimated 63 % ( 95 % CI 51 % - 77 %). The estimated sensitivity was identical for direct sequencing and other techniques . The penetrance of BRCA2 was estimated by maximizing the LOD score in BRCA2 - mutation families , over all possible penetrance functions . The estimated cumulative risk of breast cancer reached 28 % ( 95 % CI 9 % - 44 %) by age 50 years and 84 % ( 95 % CI 43 % - 95 %) by age 70 years . The corresponding ovarian cancer risks were 0 . 4 % ( 95 % CI 0 % - 1 %) by age 50 years and 27 % ( 95 % CI 0 % - 47 %) by age 70 years . The lifetime risk of breast cancer appears similar to the risk in BRCA1 carriers , but there was some suggestion of a lower risk in BRCA2 carriers < 50 years of age .",disease
"Severe early - onset obesity , adrenal insufficiency and red hair pigmentation caused by POMC mutations in humans . Sequential cleavage of the precursor protein pre - pro - opiomelanocortin ( POMC ) generates the melanocortin peptides adrenocorticotrophin ( ACTH ), melanocyte - stimulating hormones ( MSH ) alpha , beta and gamma as well as the opioid - receptor ligand beta - endorphin . While a few cases of isolated ACTH deficiency have been reported ( OMIM 201400 ), an inherited POMC defect has not been described so far . Recent studies in animal models elucidated a central role of alpha - MSH in the regulation of food intake by activation of the brain melanocortin - 4 - receptor ( MC4 - R ; refs 3 - 5 ) and the linkage of human obesity to chromosome 2 in close proximity to the POMC locus , led to the proposal of an association of POMC with human obesity . The dual role of alpha - MSH in regulating food intake and influencing hair pigmentation predicts that the phenotype associated with a defect in POMC function would include obesity , alteration in pigmentation and ACTH deficiency . The observation of these symptoms in two probands prompted us to search for mutations within their POMC genes . Patient 1 was found to be a compound heterozygote for two mutations in exon 3 ( G7013T , C7133delta ) which interfere with appropriate synthesis of ACTH and alpha - MSH . Patient 2 was homozygous for a mutation in exon 2 ( C3804A ) which abolishes POMC translation . These findings represent the first examples of a genetic defect within the POMC gene and define a new monogenic endocrine disorder resulting in early - onset obesity , adrenal insufficiency and red hair pigmentation ..",disease
"The tumor suppressor gene Smad4 / Dpc4 is required for gastrulation and later for anterior development of the mouse embryo . Mutations in the SMAD4 / DPC4 tumor suppressor gene , a key signal transducer in most TGFbeta - related pathways , are involved in 50 % of pancreatic cancers . Homozygous Smad4 mutant mice die before day 7 . 5 of embryogenesis . Mutant embryos have reduced size , fail to gastrulate or express a mesodermal marker , and show abnormal visceral endoderm development . Growth retardation of the Smad4 - deficient embryos results from reduced cell proliferation rather than increased apoptosis . Aggregation of mutant Smad4 ES cells with wild - type tetraploid morulae rescues the gastrulation defect . These results indicate that Smad4 is initially required for the differentiation of the visceral endoderm and that the gastrulation defect in the epiblast is secondary and non - cell autonomous . Rescued embryos show severe anterior truncations , indicating a second important role for Smad4 in anterior patterning during embryogenesis .",disease
"Coincidence of two novel arylsulfatase A alleles and mutation 459 + 1G > A within a family with metachromatic leukodystrophy : molecular basis of phenotypic heterogeneity . In a family with three siblings , one developed classical late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ), fatal at age 5 years , with deficient arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ) activity and increased galactosylsulfatide ( GS ) excretion . The two other siblings , apparently healthy at 12 ( 1 / 2 ) and 15 years , respectively , and their father , apparently healthy as well , presented ARSA and GS values within the range of MLD patients . Mutation screening and sequence analysis disclosed the involvement of three different ARSA mutations being the molecular basis of intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity . The late infantile patient inherited from his mother the frequent 0 - type mutation 459 + 1G > A , and from his father a novel , single basepair microdeletion of guanine at nucleotide 7 in exon 1 ( 7delG ). The two clinically unaffected siblings carried the maternal mutation 459 + 1G > A and , on their paternal allele , a novel cytosine to thymidine transition at nucleotide 2435 in exon 8 , resulting in substitution of alanine 464 by valine ( A464V ). The fathers genotype thus was 7delG / A464V . Mutation A464V was not found in 18 unrelated MLD patients and 50 controls . A464V , although clearly modifying ARSA and GS levels , apparently bears little significance for clinical manifestation of MLD , mimicking the frequent ARSA pseudodeficiency allele . Our results demonstrate that in certain genetic conditions MLD - like ARSA and GS values need not be paralleled by clinical disease , a finding with serious diagnostic and prognostic implications . Moreover , further ARSA alleles functionally similar to A464V might exist which , together with 0 - type mutations , may cause pathological ARSA and GS levels , but not clinical outbreak of the disease ..",disease
"Low levels of beta hexosaminidase A in healthy individuals with apparent deficiency of this enzyme . Appreciable beta hexosaminidase A ( hex A ) activity has been detected in cultured skin fibroblasts and melanoma tissue from healthy individuals previously reported as having deficiency of hex A activity indistinguishable from that of patients with Tay - Sachs disease ( TSD ). Identification and quantitation of hex A , amounting to 3 . 5 % - 6 . 9 % of total beta hexosaminidase activity , has been obtained by cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis , DEAE - cellulose ion - exchange chromatography , radial immunodiffusion , and radioimmunoassay . Previous family studies suggested that these individuals may be compound heterozygotes for the common mutant TSD gene and a rare ( allelic ) mutant gene . Thus , the postulated rate mutant gene appears to code for the expression of low amounts of hex A . Heterozygotes for the rare mutant may be indistinguishable from heterozygotes for the common TSD mutant . However , direct visualization and quantitation of hex A by the methods described may prevent false - positive prenatal diagnosis of TSD in fetuses having the incomplete hex A deficiency of the type described in the four healthy individuals",disease
"A mouse model for Prader - Willi syndrome imprinting - centre mutations . Imprinting in the 15q11 - q13 region involves an imprinting centre ( IC ), mapping in part to the promoter and first exon of SNRPN . Deletion of this IC abolishes local paternally derived gene expression and results in Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS ). We have created two deletion mutations in mice to understand PWS and the mechanism of this IC . Mice harbouring an intragenic deletion in Snrpn are phenotypically normal , suggesting that mutations of SNRPN are not sufficient to induce PWS . Mice with a larger deletion involving both Snrpn and the putative PWS - IC lack expression of the imprinted genes Zfp127 ( mouse homologue of ZNF127 ), Ndn and Ipw , and manifest several phenotypes common to PWS infants . These data demonstrate that both the position of the IC and its role in the coordinate expression of genes is conserved between mouse and human , and indicate that the mouse is a suitable model system in which to investigate the molecular mechanisms of imprinting in this region of the genome ..",disease
"A deletion mutation in COL17A1 in five Austrian families with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa represents propagation of an ancestral allele . Patients with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa , a usually nonlethal form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa , have generalized blistering , nail dystrophy , patchy alopecia , and dental abnormalities . Skin fragility in most cases is due to mutations in the gene encoding type XVII collagen ( COL17A1 ). Recently , we reported five Austrian families with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa who share the same COL17A1 mutation . Affected individuals in three families are homozygous for 4003delTC , whereas those in two others are compound heterozygotes . To determine if the occurrence of 4003delTC in these unrelated families signifies propagation of an ancestral allele or a mutational hot spot , haplotypes were determined for polymorphisms both within and flanking COL17A1 . Five intragenic polymorphisms were chosen based on their informativeness . One of these , not previously reported , was 2988 A or C that introduces a new restriction site for Eco0109 I . All the 4003delTC alleles showed the same haplotype for these five polymorphic markers . Fourteen microsatellite polymorphisms were selected based on their high heterozygosity and their location within 10q23 - q25 near COL17A1 . Three families shared microsatellite polymorphisms covering at most 19 cM , whereas the others shared smaller regions consistent with cross - over events during passage of this mutation through several generations . These results indicate that 4003delTC occurs on a single ancestral allele ..",disease
"Identification of a novel mutation of the CPO gene in a Japanese hereditary coproporphyria family . Hereditary coproporphyria ( HCP ) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by a deficiency of coproporphyrinogen oxidase ( CPO ) caused by a mutation in the CPO gene . Only 11 mutations of the gene have been reported in HCP patients . We report another mutation in a Japanese family . Polymerase chain reaction - single strand conformational polymorphism and direct sequence analyses demonstrated a C to T substitution in exon 1 of the CPO gene at nucleotide position 85 , which lies in the putative presequence for targeting to mitochondria . This mutation changes the codon for glutamine to a termination codon at amino acid position 29 . MaeI restriction analysis showed two other carriers in the family . The C - T mutation is located within a recently proposed putative alternative translation initiation codon ( TIC - 1 ), supporting that TIC - 1 is the real TIC rather than TIC - 2 ..",disease
"The chromosomal order of genes controlling the major histocompatibility complex , properdin factor B , and deficiency of the second component of complement . The relationship of the genes coding for HLA to those coding for properdin Factor B allotypes and for deficiency of the second component of complement ( C2 ) was studied in families of patients with connective tissue disorders . Patients were selected because they were heterozygous or homozygous for C2 deficiency . 12 families with 15 matings informative for C2 deficiency were found . Of 57 informative meioses , two crossovers were noted between the C2 deficiency gene and the HLA - B gene , with a recombinant fraction of 0 . 035 . A lod score of 13 was calculated for linkage between C2 deficiency and HLA - B at a maximum likelihood value of the recombinant fraction of 0 . 04 . 18 families with 21 informative matings for both properdin Factor B allotype and HLA - B were found . Of 72 informative meioses , three recombinants were found , giving a recombinant fraction of 0 . 042 . A lod score of 16 between HLA - B and Factor B allotypes was calculated at a maximum likelihood value of the recombinant fraction of 0 . 04 . A crossover was shown to have occurred between genes for Factor B and HLA - D , in which HLA - D segregared with HLA - A and B . These studies suggest that the genes for Factor B and C2 deficiency are located outside those for HLA , that the order of genese is HLA - A , - B , - D , Factor B allotype , C2 deficiency , that the genes coding for C2 deficiency and Factor B allotypes are approximately 3 -- 5 centimorgans from the HLA - A and HLA - B loci , and that the apparent lack of recombinants between the Factor B gene and C2 deficiency gene suggests that these two genes lie in close proximity to one another .",disease
"A novel missense mutation in patients from a retinoblastoma pedigree showing only mild expression of the tumor phenotype . We have used single strand conformation polymorphism analysis to study the 27 exons of the RB1 gene in individuals from a family showing mild expression of the retinoblastoma phenotype . In this family affected individuals developed unilateral tumors and , as a result of linkage analysis , unaffected mutation carriers were also identified within the pedigree . A single band shift using SSCP was identified in exon 21 which resulted in a missense mutation converting a cys -- > arg at nucleotide position 28 in the exon . The mutation destroyed an NdeI restriction enzyme site . Analysis of all family members demonstrated that the missense mutation co - segregated with patients with tumors or who , as a result of linkage analysis had been predicted to carry the predisposing mutation . These observations point to another region of the RB1 gene where mutations only modify the function of the gene and raise important questions for genetic counseling in families with these distinctive phenotypes ..",disease

"Identification of constitutional WT1 mutations , in patients with isolated diffuse mesangial sclerosis , and analysis of genotype / phenotype correlations by use of a computerized mutation database . Constitutional mutations of the WT1 gene , encoding a zinc - finger transcription factor involved in renal and gonadal development , are found in most patients with Denys - Drash syndrome ( DDS ), or diffuse mesangial sclerosis ( DMS ) associated with pseudohermaphroditism and / or Wilms tumor ( WT ). Most mutations in DDS patients lie in exon 8 or exon 9 , encoding zinc finger 2 or zinc finger 3 , respectively , with a hot spot ( R394W ) in exon 9 . We analyzed a series of 24 patients , 10 with isolated DMS ( IDMS ), 10 with DDS , and 4 with urogenital abnormalities and / or WT . We report WT1 heterozygous mutations in 16 patients , 4 of whom presented with IDMS . One male and two female IDMS patients with WT1 mutations underwent normal puberty . Two mutations associated with IDMS are different from those described in DDS patients . No WT1 mutations were detected in the six other IDMS patients , suggesting genetic heterogeneity of this disease . We analyzed genotype / phenotype correlations , on the basis of the constitution of a WT1 mutation database of 84 germ - line mutations , to compare the distribution and type of mutations , according to the different symptoms . This demonstrated ( 1 ) the association between mutations in exons 8 and 9 and DMS ; ( 2 ) among patients with DMS , a higher frequency of exon 8 mutations among 46 , XY patients with female phenotype than among 46 , XY patients with sexual ambiguity or male phenotype ; and ( 3 ) statistically significant evidence that mutations in exons 8 and 9 preferentially affect amino acids with different functions ..",disease
"Paternal transmission of congenital myotonic dystrophy . We report a rare case of paternally transmitted congenital myotonic dystrophy ( DM ). The proband is a 23 year old , mentally retarded male who suffers severe muscular weakness . He presented with respiratory and feeding difficulties at birth . His two sibs suffer from childhood onset DM . Their late father had the adult type of DM , with onset around 30 years . Only six other cases of paternal transmission of congenital DM have been reported recently . We review the sex related effects on transmission of congenital DM . Decreased fertility of males with adult onset DM and contraction of the repeat upon male transmission contribute to the almost absent occurrence of paternal transmission of congenital DM . Also the fathers of the reported congenitally affected children showed , on average , shorter CTG repeat lengths and hence less severe clinical symptoms than the mothers of children with congenital DM . We conclude that paternal transmission of congenital DM is rare and preferentially occurs with onset of DM past 30 years in the father ..",disease
"Genomic organization of the UBE3A / E6 - AP gene and related pseudogenes . The UBE3A gene encodes the E6 - AP ubiquitin - protein ligase and has recently been shown to be mutated in Angelman syndrome patients who lack 15q11 - q13 deletions or chromosome 15 paternal uniparental disomy . Previous UBE3A cDNA analysis has shown a coding region of approximately 2 . 6 kb and a 3 - untranslated region ( UTR ) of < 50 bp , whereas Northern analysis has indicated mRNA sizes of 5 - 8 kb . We have analyzed additional cDNA clones and provide evidence for an additional 0 . 5 kb of 5 - UTR and > 2 kb of 3 - UTR . We have established the genomic organization of UBE3A and the sequence of intron - exon borders . We have also mapped two highly homologous processed pseudogenes , UBE3AP1 and UBE3AP2 , to chromosomes 2 and 21 , respectively , and determined their genomic organization .

"Distribution of emerin and lamins in the heart and implications for Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy . Emerin is a nuclear membrane protein which is missing or defective in Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EDMD ). It is one member of a family of lamina - associated proteins which includes LAP1 , LAP2 and lamin B receptor ( LBR ). A panel of 16 monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) has been mapped to six specific sites throughout the emerin molecule using phage - displayed peptide libraries and has been used to localize emerin in human and rabbit heart . Several mAbs against different emerin epitopes did not recognize intercalated discs in the heart , though they recognized cardiomyocyte nuclei strongly , both at the rim and in intranuclear spots or channels . A polyclonal rabbit antiserum against emerin did recognize both nuclear membrane and intercalated discs but , after affinity purification against a pure - emerin band on a western blot , it stained only the nuclear membrane . These results would not be expected if immunostaining at intercalated discs were due to a product of the emerin gene and , therefore , cast some doubt upon the hypothesis that cardiac defects in EDMD are caused by absence of emerin from intercalated discs . Although emerin was abundant in the membranes of cardiomyocyte nuclei , it was absent from many non - myocyte cells in the heart . This distribution of emerin was similar to that of lamin A , a candidate gene for an autosomal form of EDMD . In contrast , lamin B1 was absent from cardiomyocyte nuclei , showing that lamin B1 is not essential for localization of emerin to the nuclear lamina . Lamin B1 is also almost completely absent from skeletal muscle nuclei . In EDMD , the additional absence of lamin B1 from heart and skeletal muscle nuclei which already lack emerin may offer an alternative explanation of why these tissues are particularly affected ..",disease

In the patients concentration of total and ionized form of Ca2+ was decreased down to 2.04 mmole/L and 1.09 mmole/L , respectively , while an increase in parathormone ( PTH ) by 36 % and a distinct decrease in 25 ( OH ) D concentration ( lower than 1.25 ng/ml ) was found in blood ; content of cAMP was also decreased in lymphocytes by 33 % . At the same time , total content of T lymphocytes was decreased 1.5-fold in peripheric blood . Treatment with I-hydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1-1.5 mg daily , within 4 weeks ) led to normalization of total and ionized form of Ca2+ and of 25 ( OH ) D , but did not affect the PTH content in blood . Concentration of the receptors to 1.25 ( OH ) 2D3 was elevated up to 39.7 fmole/mg after I week of the treatment , whereas it was decreased to the initial level 24.8 fmole/mg within 4 weeks ; simultaneous alteration in the cAMP content was observed in lymphocytes . Treatment with 1- ( OH ) D3 normalized also the T lymphocytes content in peripheric blood .

"Tumor and serum beta-2-microglobulin expression in women with breast cancer . To investigate whether the tumor expression of beta-2-microglobulin ( beta 2-M ) could serve as a marker of tumor biologic behavior , the authors studied specimens of breast carcinomas from 60 consecutive female patients . Presence of beta 2-M was analyzed by immunohistochemistry . No significant correlations were found between tumor beta 2-M expression and several histologic attributes such as type , histologic and nuclear grades , mitotic index , necrosis , vascular invasion , and lymphocytic infiltration . Likewise , beta 2-M was not associated with markers of disease extension such as TNM , ( UICC , classification of malignant tumors ) staging and axillary lymph node involvement or with estrogen , progesterone , and glucocorticoid receptor levels . However , there was a significantly positive association between tumor beta 2-M expression and the degree of lymphocytic infiltration in the tumor tissue . Beta 2-M serum levels were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in samples from 22 of the above women . Although some of the highest values had been obtained in women with larger ( T4 ) primary tumors , the authors failed to detect any statistical relationship between beta 2-M expression in the tumor with serum levels or between serum beta 2-M and the above histologic , laboratory , and clinical factors .",gene

"Kappa B-specific DNA binding proteins : role in the regulation of human interleukin-2 gene expression . Transcriptional activation of the human interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene , like induction of the IL-2 receptor alpha ( IL-2R alpha ) gene and the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) , is shown to be modulated by a kappa B-like enhancer element . Mutation of a kappa B core sequence identified in the IL-2 promoter ( -206 to -195 ) partially inhibits both mitogen- and HTLV-I Tax-mediated activation of this transcription unit and blocks the specific binding of two inducible cellular factors . These kappa B-specific proteins ( 80 to 90 and 50 to 55 kilodaltons ) similarly interact with the functional kappa B enhancer present in the IL-2R alpha promoter . These data suggest that these kappa B-specific proteins have a role in the coordinate regulation of this growth factor-growth factor receptor gene system that controls T cell proliferation .",gene
"Novel region within the V kappa gene promoter is responsible for tissue and stage-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes in human lymphoid neoplasms . Immunoglobulin gene-specific transacting factors have been shown to play a role in lymphoid tissue-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes .

We have used a model of human lymphoid neoplasia to address this question . Different fragments of unrearranged human variable region of immunoglobulin kappa gene ( V kappa ) were used for cell-free in vitro transcription and DNA mobility shift assays . Previously described enhancement of in vitro transcription that was only seen with nuclear extracts derived from B-cell neoplasms corresponding to the late stages of B-cell differentiation was shown to be dependent on the actions of these factor ( s ) on the DNA region within the V kappa gene promoter . This region is located within the 920 bp fragment located 210 bp upstream from the coding region and this fragment represents a possible novel DNA region , which plays a role in the stage- and tissue-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes .",gene

Examinations of 70 children aged 4 to 15 suffering from the nephrotic form of glomerulonephritis have made it possible to distinguish two groups of patients : with relatively high values of specific binding X = 6820.1 +/- 530.0 ( n = 30 , p = 0.95 , t = 2.04 ) , this corresponding to a clinical form of hormone -sensitive glomerulonephritis , and with relatively low values of specific binding X = 1815.2 +/- 302.8 ( n = 40 , p = 0.95 , t = 1.96 ) , that corresponds to hormone -resistant glomerulonephritis . Dynamic studies have not shown any statistically significant changes in the specific binding values . These results permit regarding the specific binding value as a prognostic criterion in the assessment of corticosteroid therapy ; this allows a wide employment of the described method in practical nephrology .",gene
"Octamer-binding proteins from B or HeLa cells stimulate transcription of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain promoter in vitro . The B-cell -type specificity of the immunoglobulin ( Ig ) heavy-chain and light-chain promoters is mediated by an octanucleotide ( OCTA ) element , ATGCAAAT , that is also a functional component of other RNA polymerase II promoters , such as snRNA and histone H2B promoters . Two nuclear proteins that bind specifically and with high affinity to the OCTA element have been identified . NF-A1 is present in a variety of cell types , whereas the presence of NF-A2 is essentially confined to B cells , leading to the hypothesis that NF-A2 activates cell-type-specific transcription of the Ig promoter and NF-A1 mediates the other responses of the OCTA element . Extracts of the B-cell line , BJA-B , contain high levels of NF-A2 and specifically transcribe Ig promoters . In contrast , extracts from HeLa cells transcribed the Ig promoter poorly . Surprisingly , addition of either affinity-enriched NF-A2 or NF-A1 to either a HeLa extract or a partially purified reaction system specifically stimulates the Ig promoter . This suggests that the constitutive OCTA-binding factor NF-A1 can activate transcription of the Ig promoter and that B-cell -specific transcription of this promoter , at least in vitro , is partially due to a quantitative difference in the amount of OCTA-binding protein . Because NF-A1 can stimulate Ig transcription , the inability of this factor to activate in vivo the Ig promoter to the same degree as the snRNA promoters probably reflects a difference in the context of the OCTA element in these two types of promoters .",gene
"Identification of a putative regulator of early T cell activation genes . Molecules involved in the antigen receptor-dependent regulation of early T cell activation genes were investigated with the use of functional sequences of the T cell activation-specific enhancer of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . One of these sequences forms a protein complex , NFAT-1 , specifically with nuclear extracts of activated T cells . This complex appeared 10 to 25 minutes before the activation of the IL-2 gene . Studies with inhibitors of protein synthesis indicated that the time of synthesis of the activator of the IL-2 gene in Jurkat T cells corresponds to the time of appearance of NFAT-1 . NFAT-1 , or a very similar protein , bound functional sequences of the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ; the LTR of this virus is known to be stimulated during early T cell activation . The binding site for this complex activated a linked promoter after transfection into antigen receptor-activated T cells but not other cell types . These characteristics suggest that NFAT-1 transmits signals initiated at the T cell antigen receptor .",gene
"Characterization of thyroid hormone receptors in human IM-9 lymphocytes . Although putatively identified more than 10 years ago , thyroid hormone receptors in human tissues remain poorly characterized . As a first step towards understanding the mechanism of thyroid hormone action in man we have characterized T3 binding sites in nuclei of the human lymphoblastoid line , IM-9 cells . In whole cell experiments at 37 degrees C , nuclear binding of [ 125I ] T3 was saturable ( Kd 34 +/- 6 pmol/l ) and of finite capacity ( approximately equal to 350 sites/cell ) . The binding sites were extracted from a nuclear pellet by treatment with 0.4 mol/l KCl and sonication . Separation of bound from free [ 125I ] T3 in the extracts was achieved using the calcium phosphate matrix , hydroxyapatite at a concentration of 0.3 ml of a 150 g/l slurry . Rectilinear Scatchard plots were obtained only when the hydroxyapatite was washed with a buffer containing 0.5 % Triton X-100 . Under these conditions T3 binding sites in the nuclear extracts were present at a concentration of 22.4 +/- 8.6 fmol/mg protein and showed an affinity of ( Kd , room temperature ) 140 +/- 10 pmol/l . The same assay system was used to determine the hierarchy of affinities for a range of natural and synthetic analogues . Calling T3 100 , the order of potencies observed was : Triac , 500 ; 3 , 5-diiodo-3'-isopropylthyronine , 89 ; T4 , 32 ; 3 , 5-dimethyl-3'isopropylthyronine 2 ; 3 , 5-T2 , 0.7 , rT3 , 0.4 ; 3'5'-T2 , less than 0.01 . These results suggest that the T3 binding sites present in human IM-9 lymphocyte nuclei and extracts thereof are thyroid hormone receptors . These cells may be a useful tool to increase our understanding of human T3 receptors",gene
Definition of T-cell specific DNA-binding factors that interact with a 3'-silencer in the CD4+ T-cell gene Rpt-1 . Analysis of the region 3 ' to the CD4+ T-cell gene Rpt-1 ( encoding regulatory protein T-lymphocyte 1 ) led to the definition of a silencer element that inhibits heterologous gene expression in certain CD4+ T-cell lines but not in B-cell or non-lymphoid cell lines . Functional silencer activity in vivo was associated with the presence of a specific silencer-DNA-protein complex in electrophoretic mobility shift assays with T-cell extracts . Formation of this complex was selectively inhibited by the region in HIV-1 containing a silencer element . We discuss the possibility that DNA-binding factors may coregulate HIV-1 and Rpt-1 gene expression through a common transcriptional silencer element .,gene
"Congenital immunodeficiencies associated with absence of HLA class II antigens on lymphocytes result from distinct mutations in trans-acting factors . Coordinate regulation of HLA class II gene expression during development and coinduction of class II genes by soluble factors suggests that common trans-acting factor ( s ) control expression of these genes . In B-lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from two independent class II-deficient bare lymphocyte syndrome patients , we observed a drastic decrease in transcription rates of the class II genes . When these cell lines are fused , class II genes are reexpressed , indicating that immunodeficiencies in bare lymphocyte syndrome patients are the result of two distinct mutations . Further studies show that genes governing the expression of class II antigens fall into at least three complementation groups ; two of these were previously unidentified in mutant cell lines generated in vitro . In addition , we report the identification of two discrete complexes , NFX1.1 and NFX1.2 , that bind to the DRA X consensus element . Though the mutation in at least one mutant line generated in vitro ( RJ2.2.5 ) affects products functioning via interaction with the X box , clear alterations in either NFX1.1 or NFX1.2 are not found in any of the mutant cell lines .",gene
"In vivo responsiveness to glucocorticoid correlated with glucocorticoid receptor content in peripheral blood leukocytes in normal humans . Dexamethasone loading tests ( 0.1 mg dexamethasone/kg , iv ) were performed in 18 normal males to evaluate the individual responsiveness to glucocorticoid . There were inter-individual differences in increase in peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocyte count , decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count , and increase in plasma free fatty acids levels after dexamethasone injection . In addition , there was a significant correlation between the maximum increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the maximum decrease in lymphocytes ( r = 0.7514 , p less than 0.0003 ) . Simultaneous measurements of glucocorticoid receptor content by whole-cell assay revealed that glucocorticoid receptor content in polymorphonuclear leukocytes linearly correlated with that in the corresponding lymphocytes ( r = 0.9482 , p less than 0.0001 ) . There were also significant correlations between the maximum increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and glucocorticoid receptor content in polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( r = 0.7239 , p less than 0.0007 ) , and between the maximum decrease in lymphocytes and glucocorticoid receptor content in lymphocytes ( r = 0.7703 , p less than 0.0002 ) . These results suggest that individual differences are preserved both in glucocorticoid responsiveness and in glucocorticoid receptor content in peripheral blood leukocytes in normal humans .",gene
"Estradiol receptors in the cytosol of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in hepatitis B virus carriers treated with interferon-alpha . Estradiol receptors in the cytosol of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the effects of interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha ) on estradiol receptors were studied in asymptomatic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) carriers , patients with chronic hepatitis B and normal controls . The level of estradiol receptors in the cytosol of mononuclear cells was significantly lower in asymptomatic HBV carriers and patients with chronic hepatitis B , compared to normal controls . This low level of cytosol estradiol receptors in patients with chronic hepatitis B was increased by the administration of IFN-alpha . In addition , when peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic hepatitis B were incubated with IFN-alpha in vitro , the level of cytosol estradiol receptors also increased by increasing the concentration of IFN-alpha . We previously reported that the response of mononuclear cells to estrogen is impaired in HBV carriers , and our present results suggested that this may be due to the low level of estradiol receptors in the cytosol of mononuclear cells .",gene
"Association of increased lytic effector cell function with high estrogen receptor levels in tumor-bearing patients with breast cancer . Tumor-bearing patients with breast cancer were assayed for their natural killer ( NK ) cell activity and for the function of activated cytotoxic T-cells , as assessed by lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( LDCC ) . Tumor-bearing patients with breast cancer had a significant increase in NK activity and in LDCC , as compared with healthy control individuals . Although the enhanced NK cell activity and LDCC were closely associated with high levels ( greater than 31 fmol/mg ) of estrogen receptor ( ER ) content in the primary tumor , no other clinical or histologic correlation between the increase in either parameter of cytotoxic effector cell function could be found . Thus , ER levels greater than 31 fmol/mg might be associated with increased cytotoxic effector cell function in tumor-bearing patients with breast cancer .",gene
"Properties of glucocorticoid receptors in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes from patients with familial cortisol resistance . In a previous report of two patients with familial glucocorticoid resistance due to reduced numbers of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) , we have shown decreased numbers of GR in peripheral mononuclear cells and cultured fibroblasts but normal affinity of GR in both patients . In this study , peripheral lymphocytes from these patients , one patient 's son and daughter , and normal subjects were transformed with Epstein-Barr virus . Reduced numbers and normal affinity of GR were found in the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes from both patients while the son and daughter had normal numbers and affinity of GR . The thermal stability of GR and thermal activation of cytosolic receptors in both patients were found to be normal . Although the percentages of nuclear bound GR were similar in both patients and normal controls , the absolute amounts of nuclear bound GR of the patients were about one-half that of normal controls . These abnormal properties of GR ( reduced numbers of GR ) were preserved in the transformed cells from the patients .",gene
"Octamer transcription factors 1 and 2 each bind to two different functional elements in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain promoter . Immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes contain two conserved sequence elements 5 ' to the site of transcription initiation : the octamer ATGCAAAT and the heptamer CTCATGA . Both of these elements are required for normal cell-specific promoter function . The present study demonstrates that both the ubiquitous and lymphoid-cell-specific octamer transcription factors ( OTF-1 and OTF-2 , respectively ) interact specifically with each of the two conserved sequence elements , forming either homo- or heterodimeric complexes . This was surprising , since the heptamer and octamer sequence motifs bear no obvious similarity to each other . Binding of either factor to the octamer element occurred independently . However , OTF interaction with the heptamer sequence appeared to require the presence of an intact octamer motif and occurred with a spacing of either 2 or 14 base pairs between the two elements , suggesting coordinate binding resulting from protein-protein interactions . The degeneracy in sequences recognized by the OTFs may be important in widening the range over which gene expression can be modulated and in establishing cell type specificity .",gene
"Identification of a novel lymphoid specific octamer binding protein ( OTF-2B ) by proteolytic clipping bandshift assay ( PCBA ) . The octamer sequence ATGCAAAT is found in the promoters of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) heavy and light chain genes and in the heavy chain enhancer and is a major determinant of the cell type specific expression of Ig genes in B cells . An apparent paradox is that the same sequence serves as an upstream promoter or enhancer element in a variety of housekeeping genes such as the histone H2B and U snRNA genes . The differential usage of this regulatory sequence motif is thought to be mediated by different species of octamer binding proteins . One species of 100 kd , designated OTF-1 , is present in all cell types and may exert its activating function only when it can interact with additional adjacent transcription factors . The lymphoid cell specific octamer binding protein of 60 kd ( OTF-2A ) specifically stimulates Ig promoters which consist essentially of a TATA-box and an octamer sequence upstream of it . Here we present evidence for yet another B cell specific octamer binding protein of 75 kd ( OTF-2B ) . From several findings , including the absence of OTF-2B ( but not OTF-2A ) from a lymphocyte line that can not respond to the IgH enhancer , we propose a role of the novel octamer factor in the long range activation by the IgH enhancer . We have used the proteolytic clipping bandshift assay ( PCBA ) technique to distinguish the three different forms found in B cells . This analysis indicates that the 75 kd-species OTF-2B is closely related to the 60 kd species OTF-2A .",gene
"Inhibition of interleukin 2 -induced proliferation of cloned murine T cells by glucocorticoids . Possible involvement of an inhibitory protein . The ability of glucocorticoids to inhibit interleukin 2 ( IL 2 ) -induced T cell proliferation in two cytotoxic T cell ( CTL ) clones has been studied . A complete inhibition of DNA synthesis by dexamethasone ( Dx ) could be observed when IL 2-depleted cultures of CTL were either incubated for 6 h with the hormone prior to the addition of IL 2 or treated simultaneously with Dx and a low concentration of IL 2 . No significant reduction in the number and affinity of IL 2 receptors was seen after 6 h incubation with Dx . The order of potency observed with the different steroids indicated that this inhibitory effect was mediated through binding to a specific glucocorticoid receptor . The action of these hormones possibly involves the synthesis of an inhibitory protein ( s ) , since the presence of cycloheximide during the incubation with Dx prevented the inhibition of DNA synthesis . Furthermore , supernatant from Dx-treated CTL contained a nondialyzable factor which inhibited DNA synthesis and cell growth of CTL clones induced by IL 2 . Blocking of IL 2 synthesis and IL 2 receptor formation have been proposed as one of the major mechanisms of glucocorticoid-induced immunosuppression . Our results indicate that these hormones may also affect T cell proliferation by inhibiting IL 2 activity .",gene
"Identification and purification of a human immunoglobulin-enhancer-binding protein ( NF-kappa B ) that activates transcription from a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter in vitro . The enhancer-binding factor NF-kappa B , which is found only in cells that transcribe immunoglobulin light chain genes , has been purified from nuclear extracts of Namalwa cells ( human Burkitt lymphoma cells ) by sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography . The purified NF-kappa B has been identified as a 51-kDa polypeptide by UV-crosslinking analysis . `` Footprint '' and methylation-interference analyses have shown that purified NF-kappa B has a binding activity specific for the kappa light chain enhancer sequence .

"Lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor binding in depression : normal values following recovery . The number of glucocorticoid receptor sites in lymphocytes and plasma cortisol concentrations were measured in 20 patients who had recovered from major depressive disorder and 20 healthy control subjects . The number of glucocorticoid receptor sites in lymphocytes from the recovered depressed group was not significantly different from that of the control group . Although the mean plasma cortisol concentration in recovered depressives was higher than in control subjects , the difference only just reached significance . This study shows that the reduction in glucocorticoid receptor numbers which occurs during acute depressive illness does not persist on recovery and is , therefore , state-dependent .",gene
"Identification and purification of a human lymphoid-specific octamer-binding protein ( OTF-2 ) that activates transcription of an immunoglobulin promoter in vitro . The octamer sequence 5'-ATGCAAAT , in either orientation , serves as an upstream element in a variety of promoters and also occurs as a modular enhancer element . It is of particular interest in immunoglobulin genes since it is found in the upstream regions of all heavy and light chain promoters and in the heavy chain enhancer , both of which are known to be necessary for cell-specific expression . We report here the chromatographic separation of ubiquitous and B cell-specific octamer-binding proteins . The B cell factor was purified to homogeneity using affinity chromatography and consists of three peptides of 62 , 61 , and 58.5 +/- 1.5 kd . Each of the polypeptides was renatured after SDS-PAGE and shown to bind to the octamer sequence . The specific DNA binding activity of the pure B cell-specific factor was indistinguishable from that of the affinity-purified ubiquitous factor . This B cell-specific octamer-binding factor , in pure form , activated transcription from a kappa light chain promoter in vitro , thus demonstrating that it is indeed a B cell-specific transcription factor for this gene . In addition to the ubiquitous and B cell-specific octamer-binding factors , we identified several additional proteins , one of which is B cell -specific , that interact with the kappa promoter .",gene
"Decreased deoxyribonucleic acid binding of glucocorticoid-receptor complex in cultured skin fibroblasts from a patient with the glucocorticoid resistance syndrome . A patient with the syndrome of glucocorticoid resistance was studied . A 27-yr-old woman initially was diagnosed as having Cushing 's disease , based on the findings of high plasma ACTH and serum cortisol levels , increased urinary cortisol secretion , resistance to adrenal suppression with dexamethasone , and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia by computed tomography and scintigraphy of the adrenal glands . However , she had no signs or symptoms of Cushing 's syndrome . During a 5-yr follow-up , no clinical abnormalities developed , although hypercortisolism persisted . End-organ resistance to cortisol was suspected . To explain the end-organ resistance to cortisol , the glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from a forearm skin biopsy were characterized and compared with the results of similar studies in normal subjects . The patient 's GR in whole cell assays had an increased dissociation constant ( Kd ) . In the cytosol of cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient , there was also decreased binding capacity . The thermal stability and the sedimentation coefficient in a sucrose density gradient of the receptors in the cytosol of cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient and normal subjects were similar . GR complex activation , analyzed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography , was decreased in the patient . DNA binding of the GR complex after temperature-induced activation was lower in the patient than in normal subjects . Nuclear translocation of GR complexes from the patient was also slightly decreased . These results suggest that the patient 's glucocorticoid resistance was due to a decrease in the affinity of the receptor for glucocorticoids and a decrease in the binding of the GR complex to DNA .",gene
"Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor . Sensitive and receptor-mediated regulation by 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes . We show that 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 , 25 [ OH ] 2D3 ) , the most hormonally active metabolite of vitamin D3 , modulates sensitively and specifically both the protein and messenger RNA accumulation of the multilineage growth factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) . The regulation of GM-CSF expression is seen in both normal human mitogen-activated T lymphocytes and T lymphocytes from a line ( S-LB1 ) transformed with human T cell lymphotropic virus 1 ( HTLV-1 ) . In contrast , cells from a HTLV-1 transformed T lymphocyte line ( Ab-VDR ) established from a patient with vitamin D-resistant rickets type II with undetectable 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 cellular receptors are resistant to the action of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 . Inhibition of GM-CSF expression by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 can occur independently of interleukin 2 regulation and is probably mediated through cellular 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptors . We conclude that 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 may be important in the physiology of hematopoiesis .",gene
"Altered interaction between triiodothyronine and its nuclear receptors in absence of cortisol : a proposed mechanism for increased thyrotropin secretion in corticosteroid deficiency states . Thyroid hormones occasionally appear less effective when administered alone to patients with panhypopituitarism , and manifestations suggestive of hypothyroidism have been reported in patients suffering from untreated Addison 's disease . In the latter condition , thyrotropin secretion is increased : this occurs already after as little as 2 days of temporary withdrawal of therapy with substitution doses of corticosteroids while circulating levels of thyroid hormones remain within normal limits . Therefore , a possible role of cortisol in interaction between triiodothyronine and its nuclear receptors was examined at the level of circulating lymphocytes obtained from patients with primary or secondary adrenocortical failure . The affinity of these receptors was found to be decreased , by more than 50 % on average , in the absence of cortisol treatments . This change was promptly corrected upon resumption of therapy . The number of binding sites was not significantly modified . The influence of cortisol on thyroid hormone receptors discussed here might account for the clinical observations mentioned above .",gene
"Inhibition by cortisol of human natural killer ( NK ) cell activity . The effects of cortisol on the natural killer ( NK ) activity of human peripheral blood mononuclear ( PBM ) cells were studied in vitro using a direct 4-h 51Cr-release assay and K 562 cell line as a target . Preincubation for 20 h of PBM cells drawn from healthy donors with 1 X 10 ( -8 ) to 1 X 10 ( -5 ) M cortisol resulted in a significant decrease of NK cell activity . The magnitude of the suppression was directly related to the steroid concentration and inversely related to the number of effector cells . Cortisol was able to minimize the enhancement of NK cytotoxicity obtainable in the presence of immune interferon ( IFN-gamma ) . A significantly higher suppression was achieved after sequential exposure of PBM cells to cortisol and equimolar levels of prostaglandin E2 ( PgE2 ) . The concomitant incubation with theophylline and isobutyl-methylxanthine failed to enhance the cortisol-induced suppression , whereas PgE2-dependent inhibition significantly increased after exposure of PBM cells to methyl-xanthines . The inhibitory effect of cortisol was partially or totally prevented by the concomitant incubation with equimolar amounts of 11-deoxycortisol and RU 486 but not of progesterone . Treatment of NK effectors with a monoclonal anti-human corticosteroid-binding globulin ( CBG ) antibody produced an enhancement of the spontaneous NK activity and a partial suppression of cortisol-mediated effects . Our results suggest that endogenous glucocorticoids play a role in the regulation of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity . Since the effect of cortisol was additive to that of PgE2 and was not changed by phosphodiesterase inhibitors , it is conceivable that the hormone acts at a level different from the adenylate cyclase - phosphodiesterase system . Data obtained with the use of antiglucocorticoids and the anti-CBG antibody",gene

"Interaction of cell-type-specific nuclear proteins with immunoglobulin VH promoter region sequences . All human and murine immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region ( VH ) genes contain the sequence ATGCAAAT approximately 70 nucleotides 5 ' from the site of transcription initiation . This octanucleotide , in reverse orientation , is also found in all light chain variable region ( VL ) genes , and in the immunoglobulin heavy chain transcriptional enhancer . Transfection studies have established that this octamer is involved in the lymphoid-specific transcription of immunoglobulin genes . Octamer-containing fragments have been reported to bind a factor present in nuclear extracts of human cell lines ; however , identical binding activity was detected in both B lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells . Here we establish that nuclear extracts from distinct cell types differ in their ability to interact with octamer-containing fragments . We have also detected a DNA-protein interaction that may be involved in the cell-type specificity of immunoglobulin expression , and we have determined that a sequence upstream of the octamer participates in an interaction with a nuclear protein ( s ) .",gene

The promoters of the adenovirus 2 major late gene , the mouse beta-globin gene , the mouse immunoglobulin VH gene and the LTR of the human T-lymphotropic retrovirus type I were tested for their transcription activities in cell-free extracts of four cell lines ; HeLa , CESS ( Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B cell line ) , MT-1 ( HTLV-I-infected human T cell line without viral protein synthesis ) , and MT-2 ( HTLV-I-infected human T cell line producing viral proteins ) . LTR was preferentially transcribed in the extracts of MT-2 although the other three genes were transcribed with relatively constant efficiencies in different extracts .

"A nuclear factor that binds to a conserved sequence motif in transcriptional control elements of immunoglobulin genes . Trans-acting factors that mediate B-cell specific transcription of immunoglobulin genes have been postulated based on an analysis of the expression of exogenously introduced immunoglobulin gene recombinants in lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells . Two B-cell-specific , cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements have been identified . One element is located in the intron between the variable ( V ) and constant ( C ) regions of both heavy and kappa light-chain genes and acts as a transcriptional enhancer . The second element is found upstream of both heavy and kappa light-chain gene promoters . This element directs lymphoid-specific transcription even in the presence of viral enhancers . We have sought nuclear factors that might bind specifically to these two regulatory elements by application of a modified gel electrophoresis DNA binding assay . We report here the identification of a human B-cell nuclear factor ( IgNF-A ) that binds to DNA sequences in the upstream regions of both the mouse heavy and kappa light-chain gene promoters and also to the mouse heavy-chain gene enhancer . This sequence-specific binding is probably mediated by a highly conserved sequence motif , ATTTGCAT , present in all three transcriptional elements . Interestingly , a factor showing similar binding specificity to IgNF-A is also present in human HeLa cells .",gene
"The new world primates as animal models of glucocorticoid resistance . Many New World primate species have greatly increased plasma cortisol concentrations , decreased plasma cortisol binding globulin capacity and affinity , marked resistance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to suppression by dexamethasone , and no biological evidence of glucocorticoid excess . These primates also have high levels of circulating progesterone , estrogen , mineralocorticoid , androgen and vitamin D . The glucocorticoid target tissues that have been examined ( circulating mononuclear lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts ) have normal concentrations of glucocorticoid receptors with decreased affinity for dexamethasone . Transformation of B-lymphocytes with the Epstein-Barr virus leads to glucocorticoid receptor induction that is less than that observed with cells from Old World primates . The receptor in these cells has a low affinity for dexamethasone . The low affinity leads to an increased loss of specific bound ligand during thermal activation . Meroreceptor generation is normal . The molecular weight of the receptor , determined by SDS-PAGE , is similar to that of Old World primates ( approximately 92 , 000 ) and the activation pattern per se , examined in vitro by heating cytosol and performing phosphocellulose chromatography , appears similar to that of human controls . The ratios of nuclear to cytosolic hormone-receptor-complexes and of cytosolic activated to unactivated receptor complexes in intact cells are similar to Old World primates . Results from mixing studies do not support the hypothesis that a binding inhibitor ( s ) or a deficient cytosolic positive modifier ( s ) of binding underlies the findings in these primates . The New World primates , unlike men with the syndrome of primary cortisol resistance , have compensated for their condition with intra-adrenal and mineralocorticoid receptor adaptations . Thus , unlike Old World primates , cortisol in New World primates has only weak sodium-retaining potency because the aldosterone receptor has a low affinity for cortisol .

"Acetylation and modulation of erythroid Kruppel-like factor ( EKLF ) activity by interaction with histone acetyltransferases . Erythroid Kruppel-like factor ( EKLF ) is a red cell-specific transcriptional activator that is crucial for consolidating the switch to high levels of adult beta-globin expression during erythroid ontogeny . EKLF is required for integrity of the chromatin structure at the beta-like globin locus , and it interacts with a positive-acting factor in vivo . We find that EKLF is an acetylated transcription factor , and that it interacts in vivo with CBP , p300 , and P/CAF . However , its interactions with these histone acetyltransferases are not equivalent , as CBP and p300 , but not P/CAF , utilize EKLF as a substrate for in vitro acetylation within its trans-activation region . The functional effects of these interactions are that CBP and p300 , but not P/CAF , enhance EKLF 's transcriptional activation of the beta-globin promoter in erythroid cells . These results establish EKLF as a tissue-specific transcription factor that undergoes post-translational acetylation and suggest a mechanism by which EKLF is able to alter chromatin structure and induce beta-globin expression within the beta-like globin cluster .",gene
"Recognition of herpes simplex virus type 2 tegument proteins by CD4 T cells infiltrating human genital herpes lesions . The local cellular immune response to herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) is important in the control of recurrent HSV infection . The antiviral functions of infiltrating CD4-bearing T cells may include cytotoxicity , inhibition of viral growth , lymphokine secretion , and support of humoral and CD8 responses . The antigens recognized by many HSV-specific CD4 T cells localizing to genital HSV-2 lesions are unknown . T cells recognizing antigens encoded within map units 0.67 to 0.73 of HSV DNA are frequently recovered from herpetic lesions . Expression cloning with this region of DNA now shows that tegument protein VP22 and the viral dUTPase , encoded by genes UL49 and UL50 , respectively , are T-cell antigens . Separate epitopes in VP22 were defined for T-cell clones from each of three patients . Reactivity with the tegument protein encoded by UL21 was identified for an additional patient . Three new epitopes were identified in VP16 , a tegument protein associated with VP22 . Some tegument-specific CD4 T-cell clones exhibited cytotoxic activity against HSV-infected cells . These results suggest that herpes simplex tegument proteins are processed for antigen presentation in vivo and are possible candidate compounds for herpes simplex vaccines .",gene
"Fibrinogen activates NF-kappa B transcription factors in mononuclear phagocytes . Adhesion to extracellular matrices is known to modulate leukocyte activation , although the mechanisms are not fully understood . Mononuclear phagocytes are exposed to fibrinous provisional matrix throughout migration into inflammatory foci , so this study was undertaken to determine whether fibrinogen triggers activation of NF-kappa B transcription factors . U937 cells differentiated with PMA in nonadherent culture were shown to express two fibrinogen-binding integrins , predominately CD11b/CD18 , and to a lesser extent , CD11c/CD18 . Cells stimulated with fibrinogen ( 10-100 microg/ml ) /Mn2+ ( 50 microM ) for 2 h were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . NF-kappa B activation , minimal in unstimulated cells , was substantially up-regulated by fibrinogen . Fibrinogen also caused activation of AP-1 , but not SP1 or cAMP response element-binding protein ( CREB ) factors . Blocking mAbs against CD18 and CD11b abrogated fibrinogen -induced NF-kappa B activation . To determine the effects on transcriptional regulation , U937 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the HIV-1 enhancer ( bearing two NF-kappa B sites ) coupled to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter .

Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines ( n = 7 ) and B cell hybridomas ( n = 2 ) established from patients with SLE and a healthy individual were used as a B cell source . These cells were examined for ER mRNA by reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction . Amplified cDNA were sequenced by standard methods . RESULTS : In all cells tested , ER mRNA was expressed without prior in vitro stimulation . Partial sequences from exons 1-8 were nearly identical to the published sequence of the human ER mRNA . There were no notable differences in the ER transcripts between patients and healthy controls . Variant receptor transcripts lacking exon 5 or exon 7 , which encodes the hormone binding domain , were identified in the majority of the cells . Precise deletion of the exons suggests that they are alternatively spliced transcripts . Whether the detected transcripts are translated into functional receptor proteins remains to be determined . In vitro stimulation did not affect ER mRNA expression . The presence of variants did not correlate with disease activity or medication . CONCLUSION : Monocytes , T cells , and B cells in patients express transcripts of the normal wild type ER and the hormone binding domain variants in vivo .",gene
"DNA damaging agents induce expression of Fas ligand and subsequent apoptosis in T lymphocytes via the activation of NF-kappa B and AP-1 . Apoptosis induced by DNA damage and other stresses can proceed via expression of Fas ligand ( FasL ) and ligation of its receptor , Fas ( CD95 ) . We report that activation of the two transcription factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 is crucially involved in FasL expression induced by etoposide , teniposide , and UV irradiation . A nondegradable mutant of I kappa B blocked both FasL expression and apoptosis induced by DNA damage but not Fas ligation . These stimuli also induced the stress-activated kinase pathway ( SAPK/JNK ) , which was required for the maximal induction of apoptosis . A 1.2 kb FasL promoter responded to DNA damage , as well as coexpression with p65 Rel or Fos/Jun . Mutations in the relevant NF-kappa B and AP-1 binding sites eliminated these responses . Thus , activation of NF-kappa B and AP-1 contributes to stress-induced apoptosis via the expression of FasL .",gene
"A small , nonpeptidyl mimic of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor [ see commetns ] A nonpeptidyl small molecule SB 247464 , capable of activating granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) signal transduction pathways , was identified in a high-throughput assay in cultured cells . Like G-CSF , SB 247464 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple signaling proteins and stimulated primary murine bone marrow cells to form granulocytic colonies in vitro . It also elevated peripheral blood neutrophil counts in mice . The extracellular domain of the murine G-CSF receptor was required for the activity of SB 247464 , suggesting that the compound acts by oligomerizing receptor chains . The results indicate that a small molecule can activate a receptor that normally binds a relatively large protein ligand .",gene
"Minimal residual disease in acute myelogenous leukemia with PML/RAR alpha or AML1/ETO mRNA and phenotypic analysis of possible T and natural killer cells in bone marrow . Here we studied minimal residual disease ( MRD ) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) who have PML/RAR alpha or AML1/ETO as well as the phenotypic analysis of lymphocyte subsets involved in antitumor immunity . Eight patients in long-term ( LT ; 3 to 15 years ) and 15 patients in short-term ( ST ; up to 3 years ) remission were studied . Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT ) assay , the limit of detection was 10 ( -5 ) to 10 ( -6 ) for PML/RAR alpha transcript and 10 ( -4 ) to 10 ( -5 ) for the AML1/ETO transcript . Simultaneously , T lymphocyte subsets and NK cells from the peripheral blood ( PB ) and bone marrow ( BM ) were investigated by flow cytometric analysis . Four of the eight patients in LT and 7 of the 15 patients in ST remission were MRD-positive . Although all MRD-positive patients in LT remission are still until now event-free , 3 of the 7 MRD-positive ( MRD+ ) patients in ST remission soon relapsed . The total populations of CD4 + , CD8 + and CD56 + [ possible T-cell and natural killer ( T/NK ) populations ] in the BM of ST patients and MRD+/LT patients were significantly ( p < .01 ) low . The CD8+ CD28+ population showed the same tendency ( p < .01-.02 ) . The T/NK subsets in the BM of MRD-negative ( MRD- ) LT ( MRD-/LT ) patients showed similar numbers of cells as normal volunteers . Basically , the total percentage of the CD4+ , CD8+ and CD56+ cell populations in the BM was increased and in the following order : MRD-/LT patients , normal volunteers , MRD+/LT patients and MRD+ or -/ST patients . The percentages of the T/NK-cell subsets",gene
"in the PB were not significantly different among these groups . Thus , the difference of the possible T/NK-cell phenotype in the BM may strongly influence clinical and molecular remission .

"Mycobacterium tuberculosis mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan can induce NF-kappaB -dependent activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat in T cells . Tuberculosis has emerged as an epidemic , extended by the large number of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) . The major goal of this study was to determine whether the mycobacterial cell wall component mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan ( ManLAM ) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ) could activate transcription of HIV-1 in T cells with the use of an in vitro cell culture system . These experiments are of prime importance considering that CD4 -expressing T lymphocytes represent the major virus reservoir in the peripheral blood of infected individuals . Using the 1G5 cell line harbouring the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 LTR , it was first found that culture protein filtrates ( CFP ) from M. tuberculosis or purified ManLAM could activate HIV-1 LTR-dependent gene expression unlike similarly prepared CFP extracts devoid of ManLAM . The implication of protein tyrosine kinase ( s ) , protein kinase A and/or protein kinase C was highlighted by the abrogation of the ManLAM-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression using herbimycin A and H7 . It was also determined , using electrophoresis mobility shift assays , that M. tuberculosis ManLAM led to the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB . M. tuberculosis ManLAM resulted in clear induction of the luciferase gene placed under the control of the wild-type , but not the kappaB-mutated , HIV-1 LTR region . Finally , the ManLAM-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR transcription was found to be independent of the autocrine or paracrine action of endogenous TNF-alpha . The results suggest that M. tuberculosis can upregulate HIV-1 expression in T cells and could thus have the potential to influence the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection .",gene
"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat quasispecies differ in basal transcription and nuclear factor recruitment in human glial cells and lymphocytes . The generation of genomic diversity during the course of infection has the potential to affect all aspects of HIV-1 replication , including expression of the proviral genome . To gain a better understanding of the impact of long terminal repeat ( LTR ) sequence diversity on LTR-directed gene expression in cells of the central nervous system ( CNS ) and immune system , we amplified and cloned LTRs from proviral DNA in HIV-1-infected peripheral blood . Sequence analysis of nineteen LTRs cloned from 2 adult and 3 pediatric patients revealed an average of 33 nucleotide changes ( with respect to the sequence of the LAI LTR ) within the 455-bp U3 region . Transient expression analyses in cells of neuroglial and lymphocytic origin demonstrated that some of these LTRs had activities which varied significantly from the LAI LTR in U-373 MG cells ( an astrocytoma cell line ) as well as in Jurkat cells ( a CD4-positive lymphocyte cell line ) . While LTRs which demonstrated the highest activities in U-373 MG cells also yielded high activities in Jurkat cells , the LTRs were generally more active in Jurkat cells when compared to the LAI LTR . Differences in LTR sequence also resulted in differences in transcription factor recruitment to cis-acting sites within the U3 region of the LTR , as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays . In particular , naturally occurring sequence variation impacted transcription factor binding to an activating transcription factor / cAMP response element binding ( ATF / CREB ) binding site ( located between the LEF-1 and distal NF-kappaB transcription factor binding sites ) that we identified in previous studies of the HIV-1 LTR . These findings suggest that LTR sequence changes can significantly affect basal LTR function and transcription factor recruitment , which may , in turn , alter the course of viral replication in cells of CNS and immune system origin .",gene
"HMG box containing transcription factors in lymphocyte differentiation . The identification of the mammalian sex-determining gene Sry has led to the discovery of a large family of related ( ' HMG box ' ) transcription factors that control developmental events in yeast , C. elegans , Drosophila and vertebrates . In lymphocyte differentiation , several HMG box proteins play a decisive role . Sox-4 is important for very early B-cell differentiation , while TCF-1 / LEF-1 play a crucial role in early thymocyte development . TCF/LEF proteins have recently been found to constitute a downstream component of the Wingless/Wnt signal transduction pathway . In flies , this pathway controls segment polarity ; in Xenopus it controls the definition of the body axis . Deregulation of the pathway occurs in several human tumors . These insights in the molecular events that are involved in TCF/LEF function in these organisms may eventually lead to the understanding of the function of these HMG box proteins in lymphoid development",gene
"Transcriptional regulation by C/EBP alpha and -beta in the expression of the gene for the MRP14 myeloid calcium binding protein . Transcriptional regulation of the gene for the myeloid calcium binding protein , MRP14 , was investigated in human monocytic leukemia cell lines . The MRP14 gene was not expressed in monoblastic ML-1 cells , promonocytic U-937 cells , or promyelocytic HL-60 cells . On the other hand , the gene was expressed in monocytic THP-1 cells and in the HL-60 cells treated with 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( VD3 ) . The level of MRP14 in VD3-treated HL-60 cells was two-fold higher than that in THP-1 cells . Among several known transcription factor binding motifs , nuclear protein ( s ) of VD3-treated HL-60 cells and THP-1 cells bound to the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ( C/EBP ) -binding motif that was located in the upstream region of the MRP14 gene ( -81 ) , as evidenced by the competitive gel mobility-shift assay . An antibody for C/EBP alpha super-shifted the nucleoprotein complex in THP-1 cells but not in the VD3-treated HL-60 cells , whereas an antibody for C/EBP beta blocked the formation of the complex with the nuclear factor of the HL-60 cells but not with that of THP-1 cells . An anti-C/EBP delta antibody had no effect on the complex in either cell . Thus , it was concluded that C/EBP alpha and -beta were able to bind to the C/EBP motif , and that C/EBP alpha bound to the motif in THP-1 cells and C/EBP beta bound to that in the VD3-treated HL-60 cells . Furthermore , to examine the transcriptional activity of the C/EBP motif , we transfected several constructed luciferase reporter DNAs into HL-60 cells and THP-1 cells . The luciferase activity of the C/EBP motif in HL-60 cells was increased by VD3 treatment . The",gene
"C/EBP motif in the MRP14 gene was confirmed to function as a regulatory region in VD3-treated HL-60 cells and THP-1 cells by the assay .

"Patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome can have polyclonal or clonal haemopoiesis in complete haematological remission . The clonality of mature peripheral blood-derived myeloid and lymphoid cells and bone marrow haemopoietic progenitors from 18 females with myelodysplasia ( MDS ) ( five refractory anaemia , RA ; one RA with ringed sideroblasts , RARS ; three chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia , CMML ; four RA with excess of blasts , RAEB ; five RAEB in transformation , RAEB-t ) was studied by X-chromosome inactivation analysis . Using the human androgen-receptor ( HUMARA ) assay , we analysed the clonal patterns of highly purified immature CD34+ 38- and committed CD34+ 38+ marrow-derived progenitors , and CD16+ 14- granulocytes , CD14+ monocytes , CD3+ T and CD19+ B lymphocytes from peripheral blood . In high-risk patients ( RAEB , RAEB-t ) , clonality analysis was performed before and after intensive remission-induction treatment . All patients , except one with RA , had predominance of a single clone in their granulocytes and monocytes . The same clonal pattern was found in CD34+ progenitor cells . In contrast , CD3+ T lymphocytes were polyclonal or oligoclonal in 14/18 patients . X-chromosome inactivation patterns of CD19+ B cells were highly concordant with CD3+ T cells except for two patients ( one RA , one CMML ) with monoclonal B and polyclonal T lymphocytes , therefore suggesting a clonal mutation in a progenitor common to the myeloid and B-lymphoid lineages or the coexistence of MDS and a B-cell disorder in these particular patients . After high-dose non-myeloablative chemotherapy , polyclonal haemopoiesis was reinstalled in the mature myeloid cells and immature and committed marrow progenitors in three of four patients achieving complete haematological remission . Therefore",gene
we conclude that most haematological remissions in MDS are associated with restoration of polyclonal haemopoiesis .,gene
"Prominent sex steroid metabolism in human lymphocytes . Steroid metabolism was investigated in cultured human B-lymphoblastoid cells ( B-LCL ) , and peripheral blood T and B cells . Gene expression was examined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification ( RT-PCR ) . Appropriate sized transcripts were detected in both cultured and fresh peripheral lymphocytes for CYP11A , CYP17 , HSD11L ( 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase I ) , HSD17B1 ( 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I ) and SRD5A1 ( 5alpha-reductase I ) . B-LCL , but not T and B cells , expressed CYP11B . There was minimal expression of HSD3B1 and HSD3B2 ( 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase I and II ) in B-LCL and T cells . Transcripts for CYP19 and HSD11K were not detected . Corresponding enzymatic activity was detectable only for 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 5alpha-reductase , respectively producing testosterone and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone . Steroid identities were confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ( GC/MS ) . One metabolite thought to be deoxycorticosterone was identified by GC/MS as 6alpha-hydroxypregnanolone .

"Human white blood cells and hair follicles are good sources of mRNA for the pterin carbinolamine dehydratase/dimerization cofactor of HNF1 for mutation detection . Pterin carbinolamine dehydratase/dimerization cofactor of HNF1 ( PCD/DCoH ) is a protein that has a dual function . It is a pterin 4alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase that is involved in the regeneration of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin during the phenylalanine hydroxylase- catalyzed hydroxylation of phenylalanine . In addition , it is the dimerization cofactor of HNF1 that is able to activate the transcriptional activity of HNF1 . Deficiencies in the gene for this dual functional protein result in hyperphenylalaninemia . Here we report for the first time that the PCD/DCoH mRNA is present in human white blood cells and hair follicles . Taking advantage of this finding , a sensitive , rapid and convenient method for screening mutations occurring in the coding region of this gene has been described .

"Biochemical characterization of the NF-Y transcription factor complex during B lymphocyte development . The transcription factor , NF-Y , plays a critical role in tissue-specific major histocompatibility complex class II gene transcription . In this report the biochemical properties of the heterotrimeric NF-Y complex have been characterized during stage-specific B-cell development , and in several class II- mutant B-cell lines , which represent distinct bare lymphocyte syndrome class II genetic complementation groups . The NF-Y complex derived from class II+ mature B-cells bound with high affinity to anion exchangers , and eluted as an intact trimeric complex , whereas , NF-Y derived from class II- plasma B-cells , and from bare lymphocyte syndrome group II cell lines , RJ2.2.5 and RM3 , dissociated into discrete NF-YA and NF-YB : C subunit fractions . Recombination of the MPC11 plasma B-cell derived NF-Y A : B : C complex with the low molecular mass protein fraction , NF-Y-associated factors ( YAFs ) , derived from mature A20 B-cell nuclei , conferred high affinity anion exchange binding to NF-Y as an intact trimeric complex . Recombination of the native NF-YA : B : C complex with the transcriptional cofactor , PC4 , likewise conferred high affinity NF-Y binding to anion exchangers , and stabilized NF-Y interaction with CCAAT-box DNA motifs in vitro . Interaction between PC4 and NF-Y was mapped to the C-terminal region of PC4 , and the subunit interaction subdomain of the highly conserved DNA binding-subunit interaction domain ( DBD ) of NF-YA . These results suggest that in class II+ mature B-cells NF-Y is associated with the protein cofactor , PC4 , which may play an important role in NF-Y-mediated transcriptional control of class II genes .",gene
"Arrest of B lymphocyte terminal differentiation by CD40 signaling : mechanism for lack of antibody-secreting cells in germinal centers . Despite extensive research , the role of CD40 signaling in B cell terminal differentiation remains controversial . Here we show that CD40 engagement arrests B cell differentiation prior to plasma cell formation . This arrest is manifested at a molecular level as a reduction in mRNA levels of secretory immunoglobulin gene products such as mu ( s ) and J chain as well as the loss of the transcriptional regulator BLIMP-1 . Furthermore , the inhibition of B cell differentiation by CD40 engagement could not be overcome by either mitogens or cytokines , but could be reversed by antibodies that interfere with the CD40 / gp39 interaction . These data suggest that secretory immunoglobulin is not produced by B cells that are actively engaged by gp39-expressing T cells .",gene
"A positively charged alpha-lipoic acid analogue with increased cellular uptake and more potent immunomodulatory activity . alpha-Lipoic acid ( LA ) is taken up by cells and reduced to its potent dithiol form , dihydrolipoate ( DHLA ) , much of which is rapidly effluxed out from cells . To improve retention in cells , the LA molecule was modified to confer a positive charge at physiological pH . N , N-dimethyl , N'-2-amidoethyl-lipoate was synthesized . The protonated form of the new molecule is referred to as LA-Plus . The uptake of LA-Plus by human Wurzburg T cells was higher compared to that of LA . Several-fold higher amounts of DHLA-Plus , the corresponding reduced form of LA-Plus , were detected in LA-Plus treated cells compared to the amount of DHLA found in cells treated with LA . At 100 microM , LA did not but LA-Plus inhibited H2O2 induced NF-kappaB activation and NF-kappaB directed IL-2 receptor expression . Both LA and LA-Plus synergised with selenium in inhibiting H2O2 induced NF-kappaB activation . At 150 microM LA-Plus , but not LA , inhibited TNFalpha induced NF-kappaB activation . At 5 microM LA-Plus , but not LA , protected against both spontaneous and etoposide induced apoptosis in rat thymocytes . LA-Plus is thus an improved form of LA with increased therapeutic potential .

"Carrier identification in X-linked immunodeficiency diseases . OBJECTIVE : Carrier identification in X-linked immunodeficiency disorders can be based on the demonstration of non-random X inactivation ( NRXI ) in affected blood cell lineages when growth is impaired in cells expressing the abnormal gene . We examined the utility of seeking evidence of NRXI to test the carrier status of women in families affected by X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) and X-linked hypogammaglobulinaemia ( XLH ) , to identify as carriers the mothers of boys with SCID or hypogammaglobulinaemia whose phenotype suggested X-linkage and to infer X-linkage in boys with SCID or hypogammaglobulinaemia whose disease was not clearly X-linked on the basis either of family history or clinical and immunological characteristics . METHODOLOGY : A polymerase chain reaction-based method was used to amplify a polymorphic CAG repeat in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene after selective digestion of the active X chromosome with a methylation-sensitive enzyme , HpaII to distinguish between the paternal and maternal alleles and to identify their methylation status . RESULTS : Heterozygosity was found in 24 of 31 female subjects ( 77 % ) . As anticipated , NRXI could be demonstrated in all lymphoid cells studied from obligate carriers of XSCID and an obligate carrier of XLH but not on a carrier of X-linked immunodeficiency with hyper-IgM . The finding of NRXI in the mother of a boy with a SCID variant showed her to be a carrier of XSCID and establishes that her son has XSCID , not otherwise evident from available data . CONCLUSIONS : This PCR assay provides a rapid method for carrier detection of X-linked immunodeficiencies , and has allowed us to expand the phenotype of XSCID",gene
"Leukocyte-endothelial interaction is augmented by high glucose concentrations and hyperglycemia in a NF-kB-dependent fashion . We addressed the role of hyperglycemia in leukocyte-endothelium interaction under flow conditions by exposing human umbilical vein endothelial cells for 24 h to normal ( 5 mM ) , high concentration of glucose ( 30 mM ) , advanced glycosylation end product-albumin ( 100 microg/ml ) , or hyperglycemic ( 174-316 mg/dl ) sera from patients with diabetes and abnormal hemoglobin A1c ( 8.1+/-1.4 % ) . At the end of incubation endothelial cells were perfused with total leukocyte suspension in a parallel plate flow chamber under laminar flow ( 1.5 dyn/cm2 ) . Rolling and adherent cells were evaluated by digital image processing . Results showed that 30 mM glucose significantly ( P < 0.01 ) increased the number of adherent leukocytes to endothelial cells in respect to control ( 5 mM glucose ; 151+/-19 versus 33+/-8 cells/mm2 ) . A similar response was induced by endothelial stimulation with IL-1beta , here used as positive control ( 195+/-20 cells/mm2 ) . The number of rolling cells on endothelial surface was not affected by high glucose level . Stable adhesion of leukocytes to glucose-treated as well as to IL-1beta-stimulated endothelial cells was preceded by short interaction of leukocytes with the endothelial surface . The distance travelled by leukocytes before arrest on 30 mM glucose , or on IL-1beta-treated endothelial cells , was significantly ( P < 0.01 ) higher than that observed for leukocytes adhering on control endothelium ( 30 mM glucose : 76.7+/-3.5 ; IL1beta : 69.7+/-4 versus 5 mM glucose : 21.5+/-5 microm ) .

"glucose-induced increase in leukocyte adhesion ( 67+/-16 , 83+/-12 , 62+/-8 versus 144+/-21 cells/ mm2 ) . Confocal fluorescence microscopy studies showed that 30 mM glucose induced an increase in endothelial surface expression of E-selectin , intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 , and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 . Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of nuclear extracts of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) exposed for 1 h to 30 mM glucose revealed an intense NF-kB activation . Treatment of HUVEC exposed to high glucose with the NF-kB inhibitors pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate ( 100 microM ) and tosyl-phe-chloromethylketone ( 25 microM ) significantly reduced ( P < 0.05 ) leukocyte adhesion in respect to HUVEC treated with glucose alone . A significant ( P < 0.01 ) inhibitory effect on glucose-induced leukocyte adhesion was observed after blocking protein kinase C activity with staurosporine ( 5 nM ) . When HUVEC were treated with specific antisense oligodesoxynucleotides against PKCalpha and PKCepsilon isoforms before the addition of 30 mM glucose , a significant ( P < 0.05 ) reduction in the adhesion was also seen . Advanced glycosylation end product-albumin significantly increased the number of adhering leukocytes in respect to native albumin used as control ( 110+/-16 versus 66+/-7 , P < 0.01 ) . Sera from diabetic patients significantly ( P < 0.01 ) enhanced leukocyte adhesion as compared with controls , despite normal levels of IL-1beta and TNFalpha in these sera . These data indicate that high glucose concentration and hyperglycemia promote leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium through upregulation of cell surface expression of adhesive proteins , possibly depending on NF-kB activation .",gene

Studies on an Ikaros O mutation have revealed an essential role for this factor in lymphoid cell fate determination and at subsequent branch points of the T cell differentiation pathway . Differences in the phenotypes of a O and a dominant negative ( DN ) Ikaros mutation provide insight into a regulatory network through which Ikaros proteins exert their effects in development . In addition a comparative analysis of the hemopoietic stem cell and precursor compartment resulting from the two Ikaros mutations reveals a profound yet not absolute requirement for Ikaros",gene
"Induction of early B cell factor ( EBF ) and multiple B lineage genes by the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor E12 . The transcription factors encoded by the E2A and early B cell factor ( EBF ) genes are required for the proper development of B lymphocytes . However , the absence of B lineage cells in E2A- and EBF-deficient mice has made it difficult to determine the function or relationship between these proteins . We report the identification of a novel model system in which the role of E2A and EBF in the regulation of multiple B lineage traits can be studied . We found that the conversion of 70Z/3 pre-B lymphocytes to cells with a macrophage-like phenotype is associated with the loss of E2A and EBF . Moreover , we show that ectopic expression of the E2A protein E12 in this macrophage line results in the induction of many B lineage genes , including EBF , IL7Ralpha , lambda5 , and Rag-1 , and the ability to induce kappa light chain in response to mitogen . Activation of EBF may be one of the critical functions of E12 in regulating the B lineage phenotype since expression of EBF alone leads to the activation of a subset of E12 -inducible traits . Our data demonstrate that , in the context of this macrophage line , E12 induces expression of EBF and together these transcription factors coordinately regulate numerous B lineage-associated genes .",gene
"Activation-induced down-regulation of retinoid receptor RXRalpha expression in human T lymphocytes . Role of cell cycle regulation . A 5.4-kilobase mRNA , the expression of which is down-regulated after treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) with various T cell-activating agents , was isolated using an mRNA differential display method . Nucleotide sequence analysis identified the 5 ' end of this RNA as human retinoid receptor RXRalpha mRNA . Here , we report the nucleotide sequence of 3.6 kilobases of this RNA , which represents the 3 ' end of RXRalpha mRNA , the sequence of which has not been previously described . Activated PBMCs also expressed lower levels of RXRalpha protein , and a DNA binding assay showed that the activation-induced loss of RXRalpha mRNA and protein expression correlated with the loss of DNA binding activity of this protein . We present evidence that the transition from G0/G1 to S phase of the cell cycle results in the down-regulation of RXRalpha expression and that cell cycle inhibitors , which block the cells in G1 phase , prevent this down-regulation . The decrease in the levels of RXRalpha mRNA was found to be regulated at the post-transcriptional level and involved new protein synthesis . These observations indicate that the levels of RXRalpha expression in T lymphocytes are coupled to cell cycle progression , and there is tight regulatory control of RXRalpha expression during the transition from G0/G1 to S phase of the cell cycle .",gene
"Epidemiology and pathogenesis of AIDS-related lymphomas . Among patients with congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHLs ) are the most common tumors of the immune system . In the setting of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , as many as 10 % to 20 % of people ultimately developed NHLs . These tumors are clinically aggressive , frequently involve extranodal sites , and often exhibit unique features that distinguish them from NHL arising in individuals with other forms of immunosuppression . Important in the development of HIV-associated NHL are cytokines and other factors that induce B-cell proliferation and increase the likelihood of mutations of c-myc , bcl-6 , and other tumor-suppressor genes with carcinogenic potential . Specific forms of HIV-associated NHL are linked to expression of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -latent proteins ; the newly described DNA virus , Karposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus-8 ( KSHV/HHV-8 ) ; and perhaps HIV . Elucidation of the factors that contribute to the high incidence of NHL among patients infected with HIV provides insights into important elements of lymphomagenesis .",gene
"Matrix metalloproteinase expression in human breast cancer : an immunohistochemical study including correlation with cathepsin D , type IV collagen , laminin , fibronectin , EGFR , c-erbB-2 oncoprotein , p53 , steroid receptors status and proliferative indices . Matrix metalloproteinase s ( MMPs ) are a group of enzymes thought to be responsible for both normal connective tissue matrix remodelling and accelerated breakdown associated with tumour development . The current study aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of matrix metalloproteinase 3 ( MMP-3 , stromelysin-1 ) in correlation with the expression of Basement Membrane ( BM ) antigen ( type IV collagen , laminin ) , fibronectin , cathepsin D , p53 , c-erbB-2 , proliferative activity ( Ki-67 , PCNA ) , steroid receptor content as well as to the other conventional clinicopathological parameters in breast cancer . This study was performed on a series of frozen and paraffin sections from 84 breast cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry using the monoclonal antibody MMP-3 ( Ab-1 ) . Stromelysin-1 ( ST1 ) was observed in about 10 % of epithelial cells in the control groups ( cases of fibrocystic and benign proliferative breast disease ) , while expression ( > 10 % of expression ) was detected in 89.7 % of tumours . The expression of ST1 in carcinoma cells was strongly associated with its presence in the stroma ( p < 0.001 ) . A significantly positive correlation was found between ST1 expression , and p53 tumour suppressor gene product ( p = 0.004 ) , and a relationship with c-erbB-2 protein and progesterone receptor status was also indicated . These findings suggest that ST1 expression in breast cancer tissue is irrespective of the expression of the extracellular matrix component , the proteolytic enzyme cathepsin D and the growth fraction of the tumour , and that it could be a potential new prognostic marker in breast cancer .",gene
"Use of transfected liver cells to evaluate potential mechanisms of alcohol-induced liver injury [ see comments ] There is increased activity of the proinflammatory cytokine , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) in alcoholic liver disease ( ALD ) . Hepatic neutrophil infiltration is a principal injurious manifestation of ALD . TNF can induce cellular oxidative injury directly , and indirectly by inducing neutrophil chemotactic factor ( IL-8 ) production by hepatocytes . IL-8 activates and chemotactically attracts neutrophils to the liver where they release oxidizing substances . Patients with ALD also have decreased protective factors for cellular oxidative injury . Manganous superoxide dismutase ( MnSOD ) is an antioxidant protective factor . The objectives of these studies were to investigate mechanisms for induction of an injurious factor ( IL-8 ) and a protective factor ( MnSOD ) in the HepG2 human hepatoma cell line . In the first set of experiments , IL-8 gene reporter constructs were used to transiently transfect a derivative ( MVh2E1-9 ) of the HepG2 cell line which expresses P-4502E1 and metabolizes ethanol . Inactivation of the NF-kappaB and 3'NF-IL-6 DNA binding sites decreased IL-8 gene transcriptional activation in response to TNF while inactivation of the 5'NF-IL-6 binding site increased IL-8 gene transcriptional activity in response to TNF . This system may be useful to assess the effects of ethanol on TNF -induced hepatocyte IL-8 production . In the second set of experiments , HepG2 cells were cultured in 25 to 100 mmol concentrations of ethanol . Both TNF and ethanol increased HepG2 cell MnSOD activity in short-term ( 72 hr ) cultures with ethanol . However , after long-term ( 10 weeks ) culture with ethanol , there was no induction of MnSOD by ethanol and there was a diminished induction of MnSOD in response to TNF . Further studies are needed to assess the effect of this diminished induction of MnSOD with chronic ethanol culture on HepG2 cell susceptibility to",gene

"Tissue factor transcription driven by Egr-1 is a critical mechanism of murine pulmonary fibrin deposition in hypoxia . Local hypoxemia and stasis trigger thrombosis . We have demonstrated previously that in a murine model of normobaric hypoxia pulmonary fibrin deposition is a result of expression of tissue factor , especially in oxygen-deprived mononuclear phagocytes ( MPs ) . We now show that transcription factor early-growth-response gene product ( Egr-1 ) is rapidly activated in hypoxia , both in vitro and in vivo , and is responsible for transcription and expression of tissue factor in hypoxic lung . MPs and HeLa cells subjected to hypoxia ( pO2 approximately 13 torr ) had increased levels of tissue factor transcripts ( approximately 18-fold ) and an increased rate of transcription ( approximately 15-fold ) , based on nuclear run-on analysis . Gel-shift analysis of nuclear extracts from hypoxic MPs and HeLa cells demonstrated increased DNA-binding activity at the serum response region ( SRR ; -111/+14 bp ) of the tissue factor promoter at Egr-1 motifs . Using 32P-labeled Egr consensus oligonucleotide , we observed induction of DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts from hypoxic lung and HeLa cells because of activation of Egr-1 , by means of supershift analysis . Transient transfection of HeLa cells with chimeric plasmids containing wild-type or mutant SRR from the tissue factor promoter showed that intact Sp1 sites are necessary for basal promoter activity , whereas the integrity of Egr-1 sites was required for hypoxia-enhanced expression . A central role for Egr-1 in hypoxia-mediated tissue factor expression was confirmed by experiments with homozygous Egr-1 O mice ; wild-type mice subjected to oxygen deprivation expressed tissue factor and showed fibrin deposition , but hypoxic homozygous Egr-1 O mice displayed neither tissue factor nor fibrin . These data delineate a novel biology for hypoxia-induced fibrin deposition , in which oxygen deprivation-induced activation of Egr-1",gene

"Kinetics of cytokine and NFAT gene expression in human interleukin-2-dependent T lymphoblasts stimulated via T-cell receptor . T cells respond to mitogenic or antigenic stimulation by proliferation and by turning on cytokine gene expression . Here we have analysed the kinetics and nature of cytokine production in human peripheral blood-derived T lymphoblasts stimulated with anti-CD3 antibodies or Lens culinaris lectin ( LCL ) . T cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) and primarily activated with anti-CD3 antibodies and cultured in the presence of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . Anti-CD3-restimulated T cells ( mainly CD8+ ) produced IL-2 , interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and low levels of IL-4 and IL-10 transcripts and proteins . No IL-6 gene expression was observed . In LCL-stimulated cells the cytokine production pattern was very similar . Steady-state mRNA levels of IL-2 , IL-10 and IFN-gamma peaked at 3 hr after anti-CD3 stimulation and declined rapidly thereafter . The kinetics of TNF-alpha mRNA expression was faster , being at its peak level 1 hr after stimulation . Anti-CD3-stimulated IL-2 gene expression was down-regulated by protein synthesis inhibitor , whereas IL-10 , IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha genes were readily induced independent of ongoing protein synthesis . T-cell receptor stimulation also induced a very rapid expression of c-jun , c-fos and NFATc1 ( NFATc ) genes , the gene products of which are involved in cytokine gene expression . In conclusion , the cytokines synthesized by IL-2-dependent T cells were predominantly IL-2 , IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha .",gene
"An animal model to study local oxidation of LDL and its biological effects in the arterial wall . Oxidized LDL ( oxLDL ) is present in atherosclerotic lesions and is believed to play a key role in atherogenesis . Mainly on the basis of cell culture studies , oxLDL has been shown to produce many biological effects that influence the atherosclerotic process . To study LDL oxidation in vivo , we have established a model in which Sprague-Dawley rats are given a single injection of unmodified human LDL ( > or = 4 mg/kg body weight ) . Within 6 hours , an accumulation of apolipoprotein B and epitopes present on oxLDL are detected in the arterial endothelium and media . The presence of oxLDL is associated with activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB in the endothelium as well as endothelial expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 . Injection of LDL enriched with the antioxidant probucol resulted in arterial accumulation of apolipoprotein B , but the expression of oxLDL-specific epitopes was reduced at 24 hours . Thus , this simple model has the potential to analyze the mechanisms behind and biological effects of LDL oxidation in vivo .",gene
"Molecular mechanisms of promoter regulation of the gp34 gene that is trans-activated by an oncoprotein Tax of human T cell leukemia virus type I . We investigated the molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation of the gp34 gene by the Tax oncoprotein of human T cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) . gp34 is a type II transmembrane molecule belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family and is constitutively expressed on HTLV-I-producing cells but not normal resting T cells . The transcriptional regulatory region of the gp34 gene was activated by HTLV-I Tax in the human T cell line Jurkat , in which endogenous gp34 is induced by Tax . Sequence analysis demonstrated that two NF-kappaB-like elements ( 1 and 2 ) were present in the regulatory region . Both NF-kappaB-like elements were able to bind to NF-kappaB or its related factor ( s ) in a Tax -dependent manner . Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays indicated that NF-kappaB-like element 1 was Tax -responsive , although the activity was lower than that the native promoter . NF-kappaB -like element 2 elevated promoter activity when combined with NF-kappaB-like element 1 , indicating cooperative function of the elements for maximum promoter function . Unlike typical NF-kappaB elements , the NF-kappaB-like elements in gp34 were not activated by treatment of Jurkat cells with phorbol ester despite induction of the NF-kappaB -like binding activity . Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter assays using the region upstream of the NF-kappaB-like elements identified an upstream region that reduced transcription from cognate and noncognate core promoters in a Tax-independent manner . Our results imply complex regulation of expression of the gp34 gene and suggest implication of gp34 in proliferation of HTLV-I infected T cells .",gene
"beta-Amyloid fibrils activate parallel mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in microglia and THP1 monocytes . The senile plaques of Alzheimer 's disease are foci of local inflammatory responses , as evidenced by the presence of acute phase proteins and oxidative damage . Fibrillar forms of beta-amyloid ( Abeta ) , which are the primary constituents of senile plaques , have been shown to activate tyrosine kinase-dependent signal transduction cascades , resulting in inflammatory responses in microglia . However , the downstream signaling pathways mediating Abeta -induced inflammatory events are not well characterized . We report that exposure of primary rat microglia and human THP1 monocytes to fibrillar Abeta results in the tyrosine kinase -dependent activation of two parallel signal transduction cascades involving members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) superfamily . Abeta stimulated the rapid , transient activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 ( ERK1 ) and ERK2 in microglia and ERK2 in THP1 monocytes . A second superfamily member , p38 MAPK , was also activated with similar kinetics . Scavenger receptor and receptor for advanced glycated end products ( RAGE ) ligands failed to activate ERK and p38 MAPK in the absence of significant increases in protein tyrosine phosphorylation , demonstrating that scavenger receptors and RAGE are not linked to these pathways . Importantly , the stress-activated protein kinases ( SAPKs ) were not significantly activated in response to Abeta . Downstream effectors of the MAPK signal transduction cascades include MAPKAP kinases , such as RSK1 and RSK2 , as well as transcription factors . Exposure of microglia and THP1 monocytes to Abeta resulted in the activation of RSK1 and RSK2 and phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein at Ser133 , providing a mechanism for Abeta -induced changes in gene expression",gene
"Regulation of cellular retinoic acid binding protein ( CRABP II ) during human monocyte differentiation in vitro . Cellular retinoic acid binding proteins ( CRABP ) are low molecular weight proteins whose precise function remains unknown . They bind retinoids and may thereby modulate the intracellular steady-state concentration of retinoids . Whereas CRABP I is ubiquitously expressed , CRABP II is mainly detected in various cell types of the skin . By representative difference analysis we found that CRABP II is also strongly expressed in human monocyte-derived macrophages ( MAC ) but not in freshly isolated monocytes ( MO ) . The CRABP II mRNA was gradually upregulated during differentiation from MO to MAC in the presence of 2 % serum . Adherence , which is important for MO differentiation , induced CRABP II expression , but the addition of 10 ( -7 ) M retinoic acid inhibited the upregulation of CRABP II expression during MO/MAC differentiation . As MO can differentiate along the classical pathway not only to MAC but also to dendritic cells we analyzed the expression of CRABP II in MO-derived dendritic cells cultured with 10 % FCS , IL-4 , and GM-CSF . In contrast to MAC , MO-derived dendritic cells showed an extremely low expression of CRABP II . From these results we conclude ( 1 ) that the availability and the metabolism of retinoids may be different in MAC compared to MO and dendritic cells and ( 2 ) that this may influence differentiation and activation of those cells .",gene
"Transcription factor B-cell-specific activator protein ( BSAP ) is differentially expressed in B cells and in subsets of B-cell lymphomas . The paired box containing gene PAX-5 encodes the transcription factor BSAP ( B-cell-specific activator protein ) , which plays a key role in B-lymphocyte development . Despite its known involvement in a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) , a detailed examination of BSAP expression in NHL has not been previously reported . In this study , we analyzed normal and malignant lymphoid tissues and cell lines , including 102 cases of B-cell NHL , 23 cases of T- and null-cell NHL , and 18 cases of Hodgkin 's disease . Normal lymphoid tissues showed strong nuclear BSAP expression in mantle zone B cells , less intense reactivity in follicular center B cells , and no expression in cells of the T-cell-rich zones . Monocytoid B cells showed weak expression , whereas plasma cells and extrafollicular large transformed B cells were negative . Of the 102 B-cell NHLs , 83 ( 81 % ) demonstrated BSAP expression . All of the 13 ( 100 % ) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias ( B-CLLs ) , 21 of ( 100 % ) mantle cells ( MCLs ) , and 20 of 21 ( 95 % ) follicular lymphomas ( FLs ) were positive . Moderate staining intensities were found in most B-CLL and FL cases , whereas most MCLs showed strong reactions , paralleling the strong reactivity of nonmalignant mantle cells . Eight of 12 ( 67 % ) marginal zone lymphoma cases showed negative or low BSAP levels , and 17 of 24 ( 71 % ) large B-cell lymphomas displayed moderate to strong expression . None of the 23 T- and null-cell lymphomas reacted with the BSAP antisera , whereas in Hodgkin 's disease , 2 of 4 ( 50 % ) nodular lymphocytic predominance and 5 of 14 ( 36 % ) classical cases showed weak nuclear or nucleolar BSAP reactions in a fraction of the tumor cells .

"Mitogen and growth factor-induced activation of a STAT-like molecule in channel catfish lymphoid cells . This article describes the identification of a putative STAT molecule in the channel catfish ( Ictalurus punctatus ) , the first report of such a molecule in a 'lower ' vertebrate . A monoclonal antibody against human STAT6 recognizes an approximately 100 kDa molecule that becomes activated and translocates to the nucleus upon both growth factor and mitogen stimulation of catfish leukocytes . This presumed catfish STAT binds the mammalian interferon-gamma activation site , a known motif of mammalian STAT binding , as shown by electromobility shift assays . Purification of the proteins present in these DNA complexes confirms that the catfish reactive molecule binds to the interferon-gamma activation site sequence . These results suggest that STAT molecules have been highly conserved in vertebrate evolution .",gene
"Isolation and analysis of a T cell clone variant exhibiting constitutively phosphorylated Ser133 cAMP response element-binding protein . In driving T cell proliferation , IL-2 stimulates a new program of gene expression that includes proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) , a requisite processivity factor for DNA polymerase delta . PCNA transcription is regulated in part through tandem CRE sequences in the promoter and CRE binding proteins ; IL-2 stimulates CREB phosphorylation in the resting cloned T lymphocyte , L2 . After culturing L2 cells for greater than 91 days , we consistently isolate a stable variant that exhibits constitutive CREB phosphorylation . L2 and L2 variant cells were tested for IL-2 responsiveness and rapamycin sensitivity with respect to specific kinase activity , PCNA expression and proliferation . In L2 cells , IL-2 stimulated and rapamycin inhibited the following : cAMP-independent CREB kinase activity , PCNA expression and proliferation . In L2 variant cells , CREB kinase activity was constitutively high ; IL-2 stimulated and rapamycin blocked PCNA expression and proliferation . These results indicate that IL-2 induces a rapamycin-sensitive , cAMP-independent CREB kinase activity in L2 cells . However , phosphorylation of CREB alone is not sufficient to drive PCNA expression and L2 cell proliferation in the absence of IL-2 .",gene
"Serotonin derivative , N- ( p-coumaroyl ) serotonin , inhibits the production of TNF-alpha , IL-1alpha , IL-1beta , and IL-6 by endotoxin-stimulated human blood monocytes . We have reported that N- ( p-coumaroyl ) serotonin ( CS ) and its derivatives with antioxidative activity are present in safflower seeds . As reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) are implicated in the signaling of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , we examined whether CS has a suppressive effect on inflammatory cytokine generation from human monocyte s in vitro . CS at 50-200 microM reduced tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , and IL-6 activities in the culture supernatants from LPS-stimulated human blood monocytes without cytotoxicity . ELISA assay revealed that the production of TNF-alpha , IL-1alpha , IL-1beta , and IL-6 was inhibited by CS . Northern blot analysis showed that LPS-induced expression of these cytokine mRNA in monocytes was suppressed by CS . NF-kappaB activation was also inhibited by CS . These findings indicate that CS has a suppressive effect on proinflammatory cytokine production from monocytes , and this effect is based in part on the suppression of cytokine mRNA expression through inhibition of NF-kappaB activation .",gene
"Elevated expression of differentiation inhibitory factor nm23 mRNA in monoblastic crisis of a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia . Differentiation inhibitory factor nm23 gene has been found to be expressed in high quantities in acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) , especially in acute monocytic leukemia ( AML-M5 ) and is suggested as a new prognostic factor in AML-M5 . We report an example of elevated expression of nm23 mRNA in a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) who developed monoblastic crisis . Relative levels of nm23-H1 and -H2 mRNA extracted from the patient 's peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow mononuclear cells were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . The level of nm23-H1 mRNA in CML cells at the chronic phase was as high as that in bone marrow cells from healthy volunteers . The mRNA level of nm23-H2 was slightly below the normal level . At blastic crisis , however , expression of both nm23-H1 and -H2 mRNA was elevated to about three to nine times of that at the chronic phase . Proliferated blastic cells were positive for non-specific esterase , and the serum lysozyme level was elevated and diagnosed as monoblastic crisis . The patient received combined chemotherapy but response was partial . These findings are compatible with our previous report that nm23 gene is overexpressed in monocytic leukemia .",gene
"Increased transcription decreases the spontaneous mutation rate at the thymidine kinase locus in human cells . Transcription increases DNA repair efficiency and modulates the distribution of certain types of DNA damage . Furthermore , increased transcription level stimulates spontaneous mutation rate in yeast . We explored whether transcription level affects spontaneous mutation rate in human cells . We first developed two thymidine kinase ( tk ) inducible human cell lines using the Gal4-Estrogen receptor system . In our TK6i-G3 and G9 tk heterozygous cell lines , the active tk allele is linked to an inducible promoter element . Tk mRNA is induced following treatment with estrogen . Spontaneous mutation rate was significantly decreased in human cell lines after induction in contrast to the report in yeast .

"CD28-mediated activation in CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ T cells : enhanced levels of reactive oxygen intermediates and c-Rel nuclear translocation in CD45RA+ cells . We have analyzed the effect of complete T cell activation ( anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 ) on the activation of NF-kappaB in CD45RA+ ( naive ) and CD45RO+ ( memory/effector ) T cells . Long exposure ( 24 h ) induced stronger NF-kappaB DNA binding in CD45RA+ cells than in CD45RO+ cells . Analysis of the nuclear c-Rel protein indicated that after anti-CD3+anti-CD28 stimulation the level of c-Rel was higher in CD45RA+ cells . Analysis of the cytoplasmic inhibitor IkappaBalpha indicated that anti-CD3+anti-CD28 stimulation induced a long-lasting degradation in CD45RA+ cells but in CD45RO+ cells the degradation process was more rapid . Because the CD28 costimulus is known to induce the production of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) , the intracellular ROI levels in CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ cells were compared by flow cytometry . ROIs were produced in both cell types , but more strongly in CD45RA+ cells . The data presented in this study further emphasize the differences between CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ T lymphocytes in ROI-dependent signaling pathways .",gene

"Biochemical characterization of MIP-1 alpha nuclear protein . A family of hematopoietic specific transcription factors , MIP-1 alpha nuclear protein ( MNP ) family , has recently been identified .

One member of the family ( MNP-1 ) is essential for promoter activity in monocytes and B-cells , while another ( MNP-2 ) is required for full promotor activity in T-cells . A third member of the family ( MNP-3 ) is expressed in PMA induced HL60 cells and probably has a role in monocyte differentiation .

"Bcl-3 expression and nuclear translocation are induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and erythropoietin in proliferating human erythroid precursors . Bcl-3 is a proto-oncogene involved in the chromosomal translocation t ( 14 ; 19 ) found in some patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia . It shares structural similarities with and is a member of the IkappaB family of proteins . In this report , involvement of Bcl-3 in hematopoietic growth factor-stimulated erythroid proliferation and differentiation was examined . In TF-1 cells , an erythroleukemia cell line , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and erythropoietin ( Epo ) greatly enhanced Bcl-3 expression at both the protein and mRNA levels in association with stimulation of proliferation . Bcl-3 protein was also highly expressed in early burst-forming unit-erythroid ( BFU-E ) -derived erythroid precursors ( day 7 ) and decreased during maturation ( days 10 and 14 ) , suggesting that Bcl-3 is involved in normal erythroid proliferation . In these hematopoietic cells , Bcl-3 was hyperphosphorylated . GM-CSF and Epo modulated the subcellular localization of Bcl-3 . Upon stimulation of TF-1 cells with GM-CSF or Epo , the nuclear translocation of Bcl-3 was dramatically enhanced . Overexpression of Bcl-3 in TF-1 cells by transient transfection along with the NF-kappaB factors p50 or p52 resulted in significant induction of an human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 ( HIV-1 ) kappaB-TATA-luceriferase reporter plasmid , demonstrating that Bcl-3 has a positive role in transactivation of kappaB-containing genes in erythroid cells .

"5-Lipoxygenase compartmentalization in granulocytic cells is modulated by an internal bipartite nuclear localizing sequence and nuclear factor kappa B complex formation . A region of basic amino acids spanning residues 639-656 in the human 5-lipoxygenase sequence resembles a consensus bipartite nuclear localizing sequence . A synthetic peptide consisting of the Kaposi fibroblast growth factor signal sequence fused to the 5-lipoxygenase639-656 bipartite nuclear localizing sequence has a prominent inhibitory effect on 5-lipoxygenase catalysis in granulocytic HL-60 cells activated by calcium ionophor A23187 . Recombinant 5-lipoxygenase was not affected by the peptide . The peptide also inhibited redistribution of 5-lipoxygenase from the cytosol to the nuclear membrane of HL-60 cells stimulated by A23187 . 5-Lipoxygenase protein was detected in nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) p65 subunit immunoprecipitate fractions prepared from HL-60 cell lysates . The amount of 5-lipoxygenase protein coimmunoprecipitated by NF-kappaB antiserum was increased following A23187 stimulation . In cells treated with agents that block 5-lipoxygenase translocation to the nucleus , 5-lipoxygenase protein appearing in the NF-kappaB immunoprecipitate was diminished . Our results implicate an internal bipartite nuclear localizing sequence as a regulatory domain that modulates 5-lipoxygenase redistribution and catalysis in granulocytic cells . Additionally , our results suggest that molecular determinants which govern 5-lipoxygenase and NF-kappaB redistribution to the nucleus may be coordinately controlled in granulocytic cells .

"Inhibition of CD28/CD3-mediated costimulation of naive and memory human T lymphocytes by intracellular incorporation of polyclonal antibodies specific for the activator protein-1 transcriptional complex . A number of indirect methods have been utilized in demonstrating activator protein-1 transcription factor function in IL-2 promoter activity . However , there has been no direct demonstration that activator protein-1 is involved in CD28-dependent costimulation of IL-2 gene transcription in freshly isolated naive and memory human T lymphocytes . To address this issue , the method of scrape loading was applied to purified peripheral blood T lymphocytes . Since scrape loading relies on adherent cells , peripheral blood human T ( PB-T ) cells were immobilized on the nonspecific cell attachment factor poly-L-lysine . Cells scraped off poly-L-lysine in the presence of Ig FITC efficiently incorporated Ig , with relatively uniform fluorescence . T cells retained their physical parameters as measured by forward and side light scatter , and functional activity as measured by costimulation of proliferation and IL-2 production after being scraped off this substrate . CD28/CD3-costimulated T cells produced intracellular IL-2 from all subsets measured ( CD4+ , CD4- , CD45RO+ , and CD45RO- ) . IL-2 production and intracellular accumulation in nonscraped PB-T cells activated with CD28/CD3 coligation were skewed favoring CD45RO+ and CD4+ subsets , as was IL-2 production in scraped PB-T cells . The intracellular incorporation of Abs specific for c-Fos and c-Jun family members by scrape loading inhibited the production and intracellular accumulation of IL-2 within 6 h of costimulation with PMA/ionomycin , or costimulation by CD28 and CD3 ligation . Scrape loading thus provides an efficient mechanism for intracellular incorporation of macromolecules , and the first direct evidence that c-Fos and c-Jun are involved in transcription of the IL-2 gene within its correct chromosomal context , in resting human T lymphocyte subpopulations .",gene
"Differential expression of Nur77 family members in human T-lymphotropic virus type 1-infected cells : transactivation of the TR3/nur77 gene by Tax protein . We analyzed the differential expression and regulation of three members of the Nur77 transcription factor family by the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) Tax protein . We have demonstrated that in both HTLV-1-infected cells and Tax-expressing JPX-9 cells , TR3/nur77 is highly expressed , whereas neither NOR-1 nor NOT expression is detectable . Transient transfection analysis further confirmed the Tax transactivation of the TR3/nur77 promoter but not the NOR-1 promoter in different cell types . Furthermore , expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the NGFI-B ( rat homolog of TR3/Nur77 ) response element ( NBRE ) provided evidence that Tax -mediated transactivation resulted in the induction of a functional protein . Cotransfection assays with the TR3/nur77 promoter sequence or the NBRE binding motif together with a series of Tax mutants have shown that Tax -induced TR3/nur77 expression is mediated by CREB/ATF-related transcription factors .",gene
"Negative regulation of the heat shock transcriptional response by HSBP1 . In response to stress , heat shock factor 1 ( HSF1 ) acquires rapid DNA binding and transient transcriptional activity while undergoing conformational transition from an inert non-DNA-binding monomer to active functional trimers . Attenuation of the inducible transcriptional response occurs during heat shock or upon recovery at non-stress conditions and involves dissociation of the HSF1 trimer and loss of activity . We have used the hydrophobic repeats of the HSF1 trimerization domain in the yeast two-hybrid protein interaction assay to identify heat shock factor binding protein 1 ( HSBP1 ) , a novel , conserved , 76-amino-acid protein that contains two extended arrays of hydrophobic repeats that interact with the HSF1 heptad repeats . HSBP1 is nuclear-localized and interacts in vivo with the active trimeric state of HSF1 that appears during heat shock . During attenuation of HSF1 to the inert monomer , HSBP1 associates with Hsp70 . HSBP1 negatively affects HSF1 DNA-binding activity , and overexpression of HSBP1 in mammalian cells represses the transactivation activity of HSF1 . To establish a biological role for HSBP1 , the homologous Caenorhabditis elegans protein was overexpressed in body wall muscle cells and was shown to block activation of the heat shock response from a heat shock promoter-reporter construct . Alteration in the level of HSBP1 expression in C. elegans has severe effects on survival of the animals after thermal and chemical stress , consistent with a role for HSBP1 as a negative regulator of the heat shock response .",gene

"A signaling complex of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV and protein phosphatase 2A [ see comments ] Stimulation of T lymphocytes results in a rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration ( [ Ca2+ ] i ) that parallels the activation of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV ( CaMKIV ) , a nuclear enzyme that can phosphorylate and activate the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) response element-binding protein ( CREB ) . However , inactivation of CaMKIV occurs despite the sustained increase in [ Ca2+ ] i that is required for T cell activation . A stable and stoichiometric complex of CaMKIV with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) was identified in which PP2A dephosphorylates CaMKIV and functions as a negative regulator of CaMKIV signaling . In Jurkat T cells , inhibition of PP2A activity by small t antigen enhanced activation of CREB -mediated transcription by CaMKIV . These findings reveal an intracellular signaling mechanism whereby a protein serine-threonine kinase ( CaMKIV ) is regulated by a tightly associated protein serine-threonine phosphatase ( PP2A ) .",gene
"Hypoxia down-regulates MCP-1 expression : implications for macrophage distribution in tumors . Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) is likely to contribute to the macrophage infiltrate in human ovarian carcinomas . Although MCP-1 is predominantly expressed by the tumor parenchyma , macrophages accumulate at highest density in necrotic regions , which are associated with low oxygen tensions . Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) can stimulate MCP-1 production and is also present within ovarian carcinomas . We have investigated the effect of hypoxia both on MCP-1 expression in ovarian cancer cell lines and monocyte migration . Hypoxia down-regulated TNF-alpha-induced MCP-1 mRNA and protein production by ovarian cancer cells . The effect was mimicked by cobalt chloride and desferrioxamine , consistent with a specific oxygen-sensing mechanism . Unlike antioxidants , hypoxia did not inhibit nuclear factor KB mobilization . Monocyte migration in response to MCP-1 was also diminished under hypoxic conditions . Down-regulation of MCP-1 expression and the inhibition of monocyte migration are independent effects of hypoxia that may contribute to the distribution of macrophages within ovarian tumors .",gene
"Activation of nuclear factor kappa B inflammatory bowel disease [ see comments ] BACKGROUND : Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines is increased in the intestinal lamina propria of patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) controls transcription of inflammation genes . On activation , NF kappa B is rapidly released from its cytoplasmic inhibitor ( I kappa B ) , transmigrates into the nucleus , and binds to DNA response elements in gene promoter regions . AIMS : To investigate whether increased activation of NF kappa B is important in IBD and may be down-regulated by anti-inflammatory treatment . METHODS : Activation of NF kappa B was determined by western blot assessment and electrophoretic mobility shift assay in nuclear extracts of colonic biopsy samples as well as lamina propria mononuclear cells . RESULTS : Nuclear levels of NF kappa B p65 are increased in lamina propria biopsy specimens from patients with Crohn 's disease in comparison with patients with ulcerative colitis and controls . Increased activation of NF kappa B was detected in lamina propria mononuclear cells from patients with active IBD . Corticosteroids strongly inhibit intestinal NF kappa B activation in IBD in vivo and in vitro by stabilising the cytosolic inhibitor I kappa B alpha against activation induced degradation . CONCLUSIONS : In both IBDs , but particularly Crohn 's disease , increased activation of NF kappa B may be involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response . Inhibition of NF kappa B activation may represent a mechanism by which steroids exert an anti-inflammatory effect in IBD",gene

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : To determine whether NF-kappa B is activated in patients with insufficient glycemic control ( HbA1c > 10 % ) , we developed a tissue culture-independent electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) -based semiquantitative detection system that allowed us to determine NF-kappa B activation in ex vivo-isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) . We included 43 patients with type 1 diabetes in this cross-sectional study . 10 of those received the antioxidant thioctic acid ( 600 mg/day p.o. ) for 2 weeks . RESULTS : Monocytes of patients with HbA1c levels > 10 % demonstrated significantly higher NF-kappa B binding activity in an EMSA and a stronger NF-kappa B staining in immunohistochemistry than monocytes of patients with HbA1c levels of 6-8 % . The increase in NF-kappa B activation correlated with an increase in plasmatic markers of lipid peroxidation . Treatment with the antioxidant thioctic acid decreased NF-kappa B binding activity . CONCLUSIONS : Hyperglycemia induces activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B in ex vivo-isolated PBMCs of patients with type 1 diabetes . NF-kappa B activation is at least partially dependent on oxidative stress , since the antioxidant thioctic acid significantly lowered the extent of NF-kappa B binding activity .",gene
"Synergistic activation of MAP kinase ( ERK1/2 ) by erythropoietin and stem cell factor is essential for expanded erythropoiesis . Stem cell factor ( SCF ) and erythropoietin ( EPO ) work synergistically to support erythropoiesis , but the mechanism for this synergism is unknown . By using purified human erythroid colony-forming cells ( ECFC ) , we have found that SCF and EPO synergistically activate MAP kinase ( MAPK , ERK1/2 ) , which correlates with the cell growth and thus may be responsible for the synergistic effects . Treatment of the cells with PD98059 and wortmannin , inhibitors of MEK and PI-3 kinase , respectively , inhibited the synergistic activation of MAPK and also the cell growth , further supporting this conclusion . Wortmannin only inhibits MAPK activation induced by EPO but not that by SCF , suggesting that SCF and EPO may activate MAPK through different pathways , which would facilitate synergy . Furthermore , EPO , but not SCF , led to activation of STAT5 , whereas SCF and wortmannin had no effect on the EPO -induced STAT5 activation , suggesting that STAT5 is not involved in the synergistic action of SCF and EPO . Together , the data suggest that synergistic activation of MAPK by SCF and EPO is essential for expanded erythropoiesis . Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology .",gene
"The molecular and phenotypic profile of primary central nervous system lymphoma identifies distinct categories of the disease and is consistent with histogenetic derivation from germinal center-related B cells . Primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL ) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected individuals . The precise histogenetic derivation and the molecular pathogenesis of PCNSL is poorly understood . In an attempt to clarify the histogenesis and pathogenesis of these lymphomas , 49 PCNSL ( 26 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [ AIDS ] -related and 23 AIDS-unrelated ) were analyzed for multiple biologic markers , which are known to bear histogenetic and pathogenetic significance for mature B-cell neoplasms . PCNSL associated frequently ( 50.0 % ) with mutations of BCL-6 5 ' noncoding regions , which are regarded as a marker of B-cell transition through the germinal center ( GC ) . Expression of BCL-6 protein , which is restricted to GC B cells throughout physiologic B-cell maturation , was detected in 100 % AIDS-unrelated PCNSL and in 56.2 % AIDS-related cases . Notably , among AIDS-related PCNSL , expression of BCL-6 was mutually exclusive with expression of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -encoded latent membrane protein ( LMP ) -1 and , with few exceptions , also of BCL-2 . All but one PCNSL expressed hMSH2 , which among mature B cells selectively stains GC B cells . These data suggest that PCNSL may be frequently related to GC B cells and may be segregated into two major biologic categories based on the expression pattern of BCL-6 , LMP-1 , and BCL-2 . BCL-6 ( + ) / LMP-1 ( - ) / BCL-2 ( - ) PCNSL occur both in the presence and in the absence of HIV infection and consistently display a large noncleaved cell morphology . Conversely , BCL-6 ( - ) / LMP-1 ( + ) / BCL-2 ( + ) PCNSL are restricted to HIV-infected hosts and are represented by lymphomas with",gene

"Antioxidant regulation of phorbol ester-induced adhesion of human Jurkat T-cells to endothelial cells . Regulation of adhesion molecule expression and function by reactive oxygen species via specific redox sensitive mechanisms have been reported . The effects of clinically safe antioxidants in the regulation of adhesion molecule expression in human endothelial cells ( ECV ) , and adherence of human Jurkat T cells to ECV cells were investigated . The thiol antioxidant , alpha-lipoate , at clinically relevant doses down-regulated phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -induced adhesion molecule expression and cell-cell adhesion . Inhibition of PMA-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression as well as PMA-induced adhesion of Jurkat T-cells to ECV cells by alpha-lipoate was dose dependent ( 50-250 microM ) . The effect was significant for ICAM-1 ( p < .01 ) and VCAM-1 ( p < .01 ) expression in cells pretreated with 100 microM alpha-lipoate compared to PMA-activated untreated cells . Inhibition of PMA-induced adhesion molecule expression and cell-cell adhesion was more pronounced when a combination of antioxidants , alpha-lipoate and alpha-tocopherol , were used compared to the use of either of these antioxidant alone . The regulation of adhesion molecule expression and function by low concentration of antioxidants investigated does not appear to be NF-kappaB regulated or transcription dependent because no change in the mRNA response was observed . Protein kinase C ( PKC ) has been suggested to regulate PMA-induced adhesion molecule expression by post-transcriptional stabilization of adhesion molecule mRNA . Alpha-lipoate pretreatment did not influence the response of PKC activity to PMA . Oxidants are known to be involved in the regulation of cell adhesion processes . Treatment of ECV cells with PMA induced generation of intracellular oxidants . Alpha-lipoate ( 100 or 250 microM ) treatment decreased PMA-induced generation of intracellular oxidants .

"Binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 to CD4 and CXCR4 receptors differentially regulates expression of inflammatory genes and activates the MEK /ERK signaling pathway . We have previously shown that binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) virions to CD4 receptors stimulates association of Lck with Raf-1 and results in the activation of Raf-1 kinase in a Ras-independent manner . In the present study , we demonstrate that HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins of both T-cell-tropic and macrophagetropic strains rapidly activate the ERK/mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase pathway and the binding of nuclear transcription factors ( AP-1 , NF-kappaB , and C/EBP ) and stimulate expression of cytokine and chemokine genes . The activation of this signaling pathway requires functional CD4 receptors and is independent of binding to CXCR4 . Binding of the natural ligand stromal cell-derived factor 1 ( SDF-1 ) to CXCR4 , which inhibits entry of T-cell-tropic HIV-1 , activates also the ERK/ MAP kinase pathway . However , SDF-1 did not affect the CD4-mediated expression of cytokine and chemokine genes . These results provide firm molecular evidence that binding of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins to CD4 receptor initiates a signaling pathway ( s ) independent of the binding to the chemokine receptor that leads to the aberrant expression of inflammatory genes and may contribute significantly to HIV-1 replication as well as to deregulation of the immune system .",gene
"Antigen receptor signaling induces MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of the BCL-6 transcription factor . The bcl-6 proto-oncogene encodes a POZ/zinc finger transcriptional repressor expressed in germinal center ( GC ) B and T cells and required for GC formation and antibody affinity maturation . Deregulation of bcl-6 expression by chromosomal rearrangements and point mutations of the bcl-6 promoter region are implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoma . The signals regulating bcl-6 expression are not known . Here we show that antigen receptor activation leads to BCL-6 phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) . Phosphorylation , in turn , targets BCL-6 for rapid degradation by the ubiquitin / proteasome pathway . These findings indicate that BCL-6 expression is directly controlled by the antigen receptor via MAPK activation . This signaling pathway may be crucial for the control of B-cell differentiation and antibody response and has implications for the regulation of other POZ/zinc finger transcription factors in other tissues .",gene
"Glucocorticoid receptors are differentially expressed in the cells and tissues of the immune system . Cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) binding studies on immune tissues demonstrate that the thymus exhibits three to four times higher levels of GR protein than the spleen . High levels of GR are consistent with the exquisite sensitivity of the thymus to glucocorticoid exposure . Nevertheless , whole cell binding studies reveal similar levels of GR in immature thymic T lymphocytes and more mature , splenic T lymphocytes . Moreover , whole cell binding techniques indicate that neutrophils ( which represent roughly 30 % of splenic leukocytes ) exhibit higher GR than both T and B lymphocytes , further contradicting results from cytosolic binding studies . To address these inconsistencies , GR protein was assessed in immune cells and tissues using cytosolic radioligand binding . Western blot analysis , and immunocytochemistry . Consistent with previous cytosolic receptor binding studies on immune tissue homogenates , thymic T cells were found to have higher levels of GR than T cells isolated from the spleen . In addition , neutrophils were found to have fewer GR than lymphocytes and monocytes . These results indicate a meaningful relationship between receptor expression and known sensitivity to glucocorticoids .",gene
"Functional replacement of the mouse E2A gene with a human HEB cDNA . The mammalian E2A , HEB , and E2-2 genes encode a unique class of basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors that are evolutionarily conserved and essential for embryonic and postnatal development . While the structural and functional similarities among the gene products are well demonstrated , it is not clear why deletion of E2A , but not HEB or E2-2 , leads to a complete arrest in B-lymphocyte development . To understand the molecular basis of the functional specificity between E2A and HEB / E2-2 in mammalian development , we generated and tested a panel of E2A knockin mutations including subtle mutations in the E12 and E47 exons and substitution of both E12 and E47 exons with a human HEB cDNA . We find that the alternatively spliced E12 and E47 bHLH proteins of the E2A gene play similar and additive roles in supporting B lymphopoiesis . Further , we find that HEB driven by the endogenous E2A promoter can functionally replace E2A in supporting B-cell commitment and differentiation toward completion . Finally , the postnatal lethality associated with E2A disruption is fully rescued by the addition of HEB . This study suggests that the functional divergence among E12 , E47 , and HEB in different cell types is partially defined by the context of gene expression .",gene
"Biased dependency of CD80 versus CD86 in the induction of transcription factors regulating the human IL-2 promoter . In addition to the signals obtained by ligation of the TCR , T cells need additional , co-stimulatory signals to be activated . One such co-stimulatory signal is delivered when CD28 on T cells binds to CD80 or CD86 on antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) . In the present study , we analyzed the ability of CD80 and CD86 to co-stimulate human T cells activated by superantigen . Using the Raji B cell lymphoma , which express similar levels of CD80 and CD86 , it was found that T cell proliferation was mainly co-stimulated by CD80 . To further characterize the consequences of this biased co-stimulatory dependency , we employed a well-defined system of transfected CHO cells expressing human MHC class II together with CD80 , CD86 or CD80 and CD86 . Proliferation of freshly prepared CD4+ T cells required the presence of either CD80 or CD86 . However , IL-2 production reached only suboptimal levels in the presence of CD86 but optimal levels with CD80 . To analyze IL-2 transcriptional activity in CD80 and CD86 co-stimulated T cells we used Jurkat T cells transfected with luciferase reporter gene constructs . CD80 induced higher levels of IL-2 promoter -enhancer activity compared to CD86 . Furthermore , the activity of transcription factors regulating the IL-2 promoter-enhancer region including activation protein-1 , CD28 response element and nuclear factor kappaB were 4-8 times higher after CD80 compared to CD86 ligation . Our results suggest that the eventual appearance of CD80 on recently activated CD86+ APC is important for the superinduction of IL-2 production and to support vigorous T cell proliferation .",gene
"Duplication of the DR3 gene on human chromosome 1p36 and its deletion in human neuroblastoma . The human DR3 gene , whose product is also known as Wsl-1/APO-3/TRAMP/LARD , encodes a tumor necrosis factor-related receptor that is expressed primarily on the surface of thymocytes and lymphocytes . DR3 is capable of inducing both NF-kappa B activation and apoptosis when overexpressed in mammalian cells , although its ligand has not yet been identified . We report here that the DR3 gene locus is tandemly duplicated on human chromosome band 1p36.2-p36.3 and that these genes are hemizygously deleted and/or translocated to another chromosome in neuroblastoma ( NB ) cell lines with amplified MYCN . Duplication of at least a portion of the DR3 gene , including the extracellular and transmembrane regions but not the cytoplasmic domain , was demonstrated by both fluorescence in situ hybridization and genomic Southern blotting . In most NB cell lines , both the DR3 and the DR3L sequences are simultaneously deleted and/or translocated to another chromosome . Finally , DR3/ Wsl-1 protein expression is quite variable among these NB cell lines , with very low or undetectable levels in 7 of 17 NB cell lines",gene
"Differential protection of normal and malignant human myeloid progenitors ( CFU-GM ) from Ara-C toxicity using cycloheximide . Cycloheximide , a reversible protein synthesis inhibitor , is thought to block DNA replication in normal cells by preventing synthesis of a labile protein . In animal systems , cycloheximide protects normal cells from cytotoxic S-phase specific agents , such as cytosine arabinoside ( Ara-C ) . Malignant cells appear not to be susceptible to cycloheximide-induced cycle arrest and , subsequently , may not be protected from Ara-C cytotoxicity . The effect of cycloheximide on granulocyte/macrophage progenitors ( CFU-GM ) after in vitro Ara-C exposure was examined using normal human bone marrow , malignant progenitors from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , and clonogenic cells from the human acute nonlymphocytic leukemia cell lines HL-60 and KG-1 . Mononuclear or clonogenic cells were incubated for one hour with cycloheximide , followed by the addition , for three or 17 hours , of Ara-C before being plated in a methylcellulose culture system . CFU-GM survival was significantly increase if normal cells were treated with cycloheximide before Ara-C exposure . Similar cycloheximide pretreatment of CML progenitors and clonogenic HL-60 and KG-1 cells failed to protect CFU-GM from Ara-C-induced cytotoxicity .",gene
"Primary cortisol resistance accompanied by a reduction in glucocorticoid receptors in two members of the same family . This report describes studies of a man suspected of having primary cortisol resistance . This conclusion is based on his high plasma cortisol levels and high 24-h urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid and cortisol excretion , plus the fact that he had no manifestations of Cushing 's syndrome . Among family members tested , his mother also had hypercortisolemia . Both mother and son had high levels of unbound plasma cortisol , but their plasma ACTH concentrations were within the normal range . Both were partially resistant to dexamethasone adrenal suppression , and both had mild hypertension without hypokalemia . To study this apparent end-organ resistance to cortisol , we examined the glucocorticoid receptors in peripheral mononuclear cells . Using whole cell assays , glucocorticoid receptors in both patients were found to have reduced total binding capacity . We conclude that these two patients , members of the same family , have primary cortisol resistance accompanied by a reduced number of glucocorticoid receptors .",gene

"Specific uptake of 1 , 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol by human chronic myeloid leukemia cells . We have examined mononuclear cell preparations from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia [ CML ] for binding of and response to 1 , 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [ 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 ] . Whole cells specifically took up [ 3H ] -1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 with high affinity ( Kd 3.6 X 10 ( -11 ) M ) and low capacity . Subcellular fractionation of labeled cells showed that binding was restricted to cytosols and nuclei . Sucrose gradient centrifugation of cells preincubated with [ 3H ] -1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 revealed a single 3.6S peak which was totally displaced with 100-fold excess nonradioactive hormone . However , we were unable to demonstrate specific binding of 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 by postlabeling standard cytosol preparations . In addition , cytosols prepared from a mixture of CML cells and 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 receptor-positive T47D ( human breast cancer ) cells had less than 10 % of the binding measured in T47D cytosol alone . However , the levels of binding in T47D cytosols were not reduced if the receptors were occupied with [ 3H ] -1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 prior to the addition of the CML cytosols . Thus , CML cells appear to contain both the receptor for 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 and an unknown substance which prevents its detection following the preparation of cytosol . Cells from patients with CML in the chronic phase specifically bound more 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 [ 18.0 +/- 3.2 ( S.E. ) fmol/10 ( 7 ) cells ] than did those in acute myeloid transformation [ 7.2 +/- 1.5 ] or than did cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia [ 2.6 +/- 0.8 ] .

"Effect of cell cycle position on dexamethasone binding by mouse and human lymphoid cell lines : correlation between an increase in dexamethasone binding during S phase and dexamethasone sensitivity . We determined the effect of cell cycle position on the amount of dexamethasone that was specifically bound by mouse and human lymphoid cell lines . Cell lines that were either sensitive or resistant to growth inhibition by dexamethasone were compared . Exponentially growing cells were separated by centrifugal elutriation into fractions that corresponded to different positions in the cell cycle . The cell cycle phase distribution of each fraction was estimated by flow cytometry and autoradiography . The amount of dexamethasone bound per cell in each fraction was measured by a whole cell binding assay . In three dexamethasone-sensitive cell lines ( two mouse and one human ) , we found that the amount of dexamethasone bound per cell increased 2-4-fold between G1 phase and S phase , and then decreased during G2/M phase . Results were the same when the amount of dexamethasone bound per milligram of cell protein was measured . Binding affinity was the same during G1 phase and S phase , but the proportion of bound dexamethasone that translocated to the nucleus was greater during S phase . In contrast , we found that the amount of dexamethasone bound per cell by three dexamethasone-resistant cell lines ( two mouse and one human ) did not increase during S phase . Our results indicate that cell cycle changes in dexamethasone binding are not simply related to changes in cell protein or cell volume during the cell cycle . An increase in dexamethasone binding during S phase may be required for dexamethasone to inhibit cell growth , and a failure of dexamethasone binding to increase during S phase might represent a new mechanism of dexamethasone resistance in lymphoid cells .",gene
"Presence and steroid inducibility of glutamine synthetase in human leukemic cells . Glutamine synthetase ( EC 6.3.1.2 ; GS ) is present in lymphoblasts from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) as well as in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes . In 16 out of 20 ALL patients studied exposure of the cells to physiological concentrations of dexamethasone in vitro increased enzyme activity above the control levels . The increase was specific for glucocorticoid receptor ligands . A direct correlation was found between the magnitude of glucocorticoid-mediated increase of GS activity and the cellular levels of specific glucocorticoid receptors assayed in the same cell specimen . Moreover , the basal levels of the enzyme measured in cells prior to exposure to dexamethasone correlated negatively with receptor density . It is suggested that the presence of steroid-inducible GS in ALL cells may prove to be a marker for functional receptor sites .",gene
"Binding of progestins to the glucocorticoid receptor . Correlation to their glucocorticoid-like effects on in vitro functions of human mononuclear leukocytes . A number of physiological and synthetic progestins were tested for their ability to compete with [ 3H ] dexamethasone for the binding to the glucocorticoid receptor of human mononuclear leukocytes and their ability to elicit glucocorticoid-like effects on the same cells . As compared to the reference compound dexamethasone ( relative receptor binding affinity defined as 100 % ) , two potent synthetic progestins with a pregnane-type structure , megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate , were found to display a considerable binding affinity towards the receptor ( 46 and 42 % , respectively ) . The relative binding affinity of the naturally occurring ligand , cortisol , to the receptor was clearly lower ( 25 % ) . The effective binding of medroxyprogesterone acetate to the glucocorticoid receptor was confirmed by direct binding studies utilizing a tritiated derivative of this steroid . No evidence for the existence of a specific progesterone receptor in human mononuclear leukocytes was obtained as judged by the results of competition experiments where a progesterone receptor-specific ligand [ 3H ] Org 2058 was used . Medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate also induced glucocorticoid-like effects on the lymphocyte functions . These included inhibition of the proliferative responses to the T-cell mitogens concanavalin A and phytohaemagglutinin and an enhanced accumulation of immunoglobulin secreting cells in pokeweed mitogen-stimulated cultures . The progestin effect appears to be mediated through a radiosensitive ( suppressor ) subpopulation of T lymphocytes . In contrast , the synthetic progestins related structurally to 19-nortestosterone , norethisterone and d-norgestrel , were virtually devoid of binding affinity towards the glucocorticoid receptor nor did they measurably influence the in vitro lymphocyte functions . These studies demonstrate that certain",gene
progestins in common clinical use probably possess inherent glucocorticoid activity and suggest that side effects attributable to this character ( e.g. suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis ) might be expected when these compounds are used in pharmacological doses .,gene
"Metabolic and ultrastructural aspects of the in vitro lysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by glucocorticoids . Human chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) cells like prothymocytes and immunoactivated T-lymphocytes are readily lysed in vitro by pharmacological concentrations of glucocorticoids such as cortisol , whereas peripheral blood lymphocytes and thymocytes are unaffected by the hormone . In this study , metabolic and ultrastructural aspects of the cortisol-induced killing process of CLL cells are recorded . In vitro lysis was found to be temperature dependent and was detected only after 6 to 8 hr incubation with cortisol by means of the trypan blue exclusion test . However , 30 min of incubation with cortisol at either 37 degrees or 4 degrees followed by the removal of the hormone was still sufficient to induce the lytic process . Ultrastructural studies demonstrated sequential changes in the cytoplasm , including swelling of mitochondria and cytoplasmic decompartmentalization , followed by loss of surface microvilli with the appearance of `` holes '' in the cell membrane , and subsequent condensation of nuclear chromatin . The large holes in the membrane appearing after 6 hr of incubation with the hormone may be the cause for the penetration of the viable stain into the dead cells , as seen by light microscopy . Addition of metabolic inhibitors including actinomycin D , puromycin , and cycloheximide following administration of cortisol resulted in inhibition of the cell lysis . An excess of an antagonist such as cortexolone was found to inhibit the cortisol-induced cytolysis of the CLL cells . It is suggested that the glucocorticoid-induced lysis of human CLL cells is similar to the phenomenon observed in rat or murine lymphocytes and is mediated by interaction of the steroid molecule with the cytoplasmic receptor . The resulting complex appears to activate specific gene ( s ) the products of which eventually cause cytolysis .",gene
"Glucocorticoid receptors in lymphoid tumors . There is a range of levels of glucocorticoid receptor numbers seen in the various subclasses of acute lymphatic leukemia ( ALL ) . This variability can not be explained by the known correlation between active cell proliferation and an increase in the number of receptors , since the tumors with the highest growth fraction ( i.e. , Burkitt 's lymphoma and T-cell leukemia ) tend to have lower average receptor numbers than do tumors with lower growth fractions such as common ALL . All clinical specimens from patients with lymphatic leukemia have some measurable level of glucocorticoid receptors ; therefore , the resistance seen in vivo can not be explained by the lack of receptors . However , there has been a positive correlation , in our hands , with receptor level and prognosis . On the basis of in vitro models , it is proposed that perhaps the high receptor cell lines ( i.e. , common ALL of childhood ) have relative stability of their genetic material making glucocorticoid-resistant mutations less likely to occur in patients with these cells than in low-receptor cell lines ( i.e. , T-cell leukemia ) . This greater genetic variability in the low-receptor lines could account for the earlier emergence of clinical glucocorticoid resistance in these patients .",gene

"Aldosterone-receptor deficiency in pseudohypoaldosteronism . Pseudohypoaldosteronism , a syndrome characterized by salt wasting and failure to thrive , usually presents in infancy as high urinary levels of sodium despite hyponatremia , hyperkalemia , hyperreninemia , and elevated aldosterone levels . We have investigated this syndrome for the possibility of abnormal Type I or `` mineralocorticoid-like '' receptors , which have intrinsic steroid specificity indistinguishable from that of renal mineralocorticoid receptors and are found in many tissues and cells , including mononuclear leukocytes . We have studied three patients with pseudohypoaldosteronism : the 28-year-old index case in Melbourne ( Patient 1 ) and two siblings in Munich , eight and two years of age ( Patients 2 and 3 ) ; clinically , Patient 3 had a less severe case than his sister . Percoll-separated control monocytes bound [ 3H ] aldosterone with high affinity ( Kd approximately 3 nM ) and limited capacity ( 150 to 600 sites per cell ) . On repeated examination , no [ 3H ] aldosterone binding was found in monocytes from Patients 1 and 2 ; in Patient 3 , the levels were 62 sites per cell , more than 2 S.D. below those of the control . Levels in the parents of the Munich patients ( first cousins ) were normal . It appears that pseudohypoaldosteronism is caused by a Type I receptor defect , that the defect may be complete or partial , that transmission may be autosomal recessive , and that the study of patients with pseudohypoaldosteronism may indicate physiologic roles for Type I receptors in nonepithelial tissues .",gene
"Glucocorticoid inhibition of urokinase-like plasminogen activators in cultured human lymphoblasts . Two human lymphoblast cell lines , LICR-LON-HMy2 ( HMy2 cells ) and GM4672A cells , are moderately growth inhibited by dexamethasone ( 1 , 4-pregnadien-9-fluoro-16 alpha-methyl-11 beta , 17 alpha , 21-triol-3 , 20-dione ) ( Dex ) . Both cell types secrete a urokinase ( UK ) -like plasminogen activator ( PA ) . Treatment of both HMy2 and GM4672A cells with Dex for 1-4 days inhibits extracellular PA activity in a concentration-dependent manner , being half-maximal at approximately 1 X 10 ( -9 ) M . Inhibition of PA in both cell types is specific for active glucocorticoids , and this specificity parallels the ability of various steroids to bind to glucocorticoid receptors . HMy2 cell PA is fully suppressible by Dex , whereas up to one third of the activator expressed by GM4672A cells is resistant to glucocorticoid inhibition . Mixing experiments using a UK standard and conditioned media from Dex-treated cells suggest an absence of glucocorticoid-inducible inhibitors to UK or plasmin in both cell types . However , conditioned media from Dex-treated GM4672A cells inhibits a portion of the homologous cellular activator in conditioned media from control GM4672A cells . Thus , low levels of glucocorticoid-inducible inhibitors may contribute to , but can not fully account for , Dex inhibition of GM4672A PA activity . Glucocorticoid-inducible inhibitors in HMy2 cells are either totally absent or are present at undetectable levels . Thus , regulation of UK-like PAs in HMy2 and GM4672A cells differs with respect to the extent to which glucocorticoids inhibit constitutively expressed activator levels , as well as the possible contribution of glucocorticoid-inducible inhibitors to the regulatory process in GM4672A cells",gene

"Short-term and long-term effects of estrogen on lymphoid tissues and lymphoid cells with some remarks on the significance for carcinogenesis . Estrogens have long been thought to play a role in regulating the immune system . The difference in some types of immune responses between males and females is well-known , as is the pronounced thymic involution induced by exogenous estrogens . Estrogens stimulate some aspects of macrophage activity and , depending on dose and mitogen , inhibit or stimulate lymphocyte proliferative response in vitro . Another example is the estrogen effect on the delayed type hypersensitivity response . A broad review is given of such estrogen effects on lymphoid tissue and immune response . Most of the studies published so far are phenomenological . However , the recent description of estrogen receptors in the thymus and in some lymphocyte subpopulations , as well as a deeper understanding of regulating factors in the immune system , open the possibility of a more detailed understanding of the estrogen mechanism of interference . Estrogen effects in adults are reversible . After treating neonatal mice with the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) , disturbances are induced in lymphocyte populations and lymphocyte functions which are permanent and irreversible . Lymphocytes from adult , neonatally DES-treated female mice have a reduced mitogen response to ConA and LPS ( T and B cell mitogen ) and the delayed type hypersensitivity response is depressed . A detailed analysis demonstrated a decreased T helper cell population . The activity of Natural Killer cells is permanently reduced and this functional impairment is related to a decreased number of these cells , in turn determined at the bone marrow level . The same animals have an increased sensitivity to chemical carcinogens ( methylcholanthrene ) and they spontaneously develop epithelial changes in the uterine cervix which morphologically are similar to adenocarcinoma . The association between estrogen-associated malignancy and estrogen effects in lymphocyte functions deserves further study .",gene
"Drugs affecting the hormonal receptors of normal and leukaemic peripheral leucocytes . The authors investigated the behaviour of steroid hormone uptake in leukaemic cells ( CML , CLL , AML , ALL ) , in basal conditions and after incubation with drugs which modify the cellular concentration of cAMP , PGE and PGF . The results demonstrated the presence in leukaemic cells of an alteration in the incorporation of steroid hormones . This alteration was scarcely modified by incubation with theophylline , which increases cellular concentration of cAMP . On the other hand , it was moderately counteracted by thioproline and was evidently inhibited by flurbiprofen , which also reduced cellular concentrations of prostaglandins , particularly PGE2 , with the exception of PGF2 which showed a poor response . Differences were observed in the behavior of hormonal uptake of CML , in contrast to that of AML , CLL and ALL peripheral leucocytes .",gene
"Human breast cancer and impaired NK cell function . Recent advances in tumor immunology have led to the discovery of a new lymphoid cell with unique antitumor activity . Natural killer ( NK ) cells form an antitumor surveillance system and appear to be vital in preventing tumor growth and metastasis in animal models . We studied NK activity in patients with benign and malignant breast disease , using a chromium-51 release microtiter cytotoxicity assay with K562 cells as targets . Compared with benign controls , patients with malignancies had significantly depressed NK -mediated lysis ( P less than 0.01 ) . Furthermore , lysis in those with advanced disease ( stages II , III , and IV ) was significantly less than in those with limited disease ( stage I ) ( P less than 0.01 ) . NK activity was not correlated to estrogen or progesterone receptor states . Positive correlation of a depressed natural killer activity with the extent of tumor spread supports the concept of an NK cell immune surveillance system in breast cancer and emphasizes its importance in this malignancy .",gene
"Immunosuppressive effect of serum progesterone during pregnancy depends on the progesterone binding capacity of the lymphocytes . Cytotoxic activity and progesterone binding capacity of the lymphocytes , together with serum progesterone concentrations , were determined in women with normal pregnancy or with a clinical diagnosis of threatened abortion or threatened premature labour . The lymphocytes of women with threatened abortion or threatened premature labour showed significantly higher cytotoxic activity ( P less than 0.001 ) and significantly lower progesterone binding capacity ( P less than 0.001 ) than did lymphocytes obtained from the healthy pregnant women . Significant inverse correlation was found between progesterone binding capacity and cytotoxic activity of the lymphocytes ( P less than 0.001 ) , but the progesterone concentration of the pregnancy serum appeared to have no influence on the other two parameters . The findings indicate that intact progesterone binding capacity of the lymphocytes is an essential factor for the manifestation of the blocking effect exerted by pregnancy serum on lymphocyte cytotoxicity in vitro .",gene
"Serum sex steroid and peptide hormone concentrations , and endometrial estrogen and progestin receptor levels during administration of human leukocyte interferon . Five normally cycling healthy women were given daily subcutaneous injections of human leukocyte interferon ( 3 X 10 ( 6 ) units/day ) from the 3rd through 23rd day of the menstrual cycle , and serum steroid and peptide hormone concentrations monitored at 3-day intervals during the treatment and the preceding control cycle . Concentrations of cytosol and nuclear estrogen receptors ( ERC and ERN , respectively ) and progestin receptors ( PRC and PRN ) were also measured from endometrial biopsies taken on the 24th day of the control and treatment cycle . In addition , an extensive monitoring of clinical chemical and hematological tests from the blood samples were performed . Serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations were significantly decreased during the treatment cycle , suggesting that interferon interacts in vivo with the function of both FSH and LH . No significant changes were observed in the serum peptide hormone concentrations measured ( FSH , LH , prolactin , insulin , growth hormone and TSH ) ; neither were the levels of endometrial ERC , ERN , PRC and PRN affected by interferon administration . As expected , interferon administration resulted in decreased leukocyte counts . Moreover , an increasing tendency in the activities of serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase during the interferon therapy shows that interferon may slightly interfere with the liver function . These results suggest that one of the mechanisms by which interferon treatment may affect the growth of hormone-dependent neoplasms could be the interaction with production and/or function of circulating hormonal compounds .",gene
"[ Glucocorticoid receptor level in the blood leukocytes in different acute diseases ] Content of glucocorticoid receptors in cytosol of blood leukocytes , concentration of cortisol and amount of leukocytes in blood were studied in 20 patients with acute impairments within the second day of the disease .

Distinct increase in amount of the leukocyte glucocorticoid receptors was found in patients with poisoning by dichlorethane and hypnotic drugs under conditions of acute myocardial infarction . In acute pancreatitis content of the leukocyte receptors was not altered as compared with controls . Concentration of endogenous cortisol was increased in blood of all the patients , except of the cases of acetate intoxication .

"Therapeutic concentrations of glucocorticoids suppress the antimicrobial activity of human macrophages without impairing their responsiveness to gamma interferon . By exposing human blood-derived macrophages and alveolar macrophages in vitro to dexamethasone , we showed in these studies that glucocorticoids markedly suppress the antimicrobial activity of macrophages but not macrophage activation by lymphokines . As little as 2.5 X 10 ( -8 ) mol/liter of dexamethasone prevented macrophages from inhibiting germination of Aspergillus spores or from eliminating ingested bacteria such as Listeria , Nocardia , or Salmonella . Damage to macrophage function was inhibited by progesterone and appeared to be receptor-mediated . In accordance with in vivo observations , dexamethasone required 24-36 h to suppress antimicrobial activity . While glucocorticoids interfered with base-line activity of macrophages , dexamethasone concentrations comparable to drug levels in patients had no effect on macrophage activation . Proliferating lymphocytes and gamma-interferon thus increased the antimicrobial activity of phagocytes exposed to glucocorticoids over that of control cells . Macrophage activation and correction of the dexamethasone effect by gamma-interferon , however , was dependent on the pathogen . The lymphokine enhanced the antimicrobial activity of dexamethasone-treated macrophages against Listeria and Salmonella but not against Aspergillus or Nocardia . Dexamethasone-induced damage to the antimicrobial activity of human macrophages in vitro parallels observations that glucocorticoids render laboratory animals susceptible to listeriosis and aspergillosis by damaging resident macrophages . Suppression of macrophage antimicrobial activity should thus be considered when treating patients with glucocorticoids ; its prevention by gamma-interferon might be beneficial for some but not all pathogens .",gene
"Interleukin 2 receptor ( Tac antigen ) expression in HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemia . Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) is a lymphokine synthesized by some T-cells following activation . Resting T-cells do not express IL-2 receptors , but receptors are rapidly expressed on T-cells following interaction of antigens , mitogens , or monoclonal antibodies with the antigen-specific T-cell receptor complex . Using anti-Tac , a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the IL-2 receptor , the receptor has been purified and shown to be a Mr 33 , 000 peptide that is posttranslationally glycosylated to a Mr 55 , 000 mature form . Normal resting T-cells and most leukemic T-cell populations do not express IL-2 receptors ; however , the leukemic cells of the 11 patients examined who had human T-cell lymphotropic virus-associated adult T-cell leukemia expressed the Tac antigen . In human T-cell lymphotropic virus-I infected cells , the Mr 42 , 000 long open reading frame protein encoded in part by the pX region of this virus may act as a transacting transcriptional activator that induces IL-2 receptor gene transcription , thus providing an explanation for the constant association of IL-2 receptor expression with adult T-cell lymphotropic virus-I infection of lymphoid cells . The constant expression of large numbers of IL-2 receptors which may be aberrant may play a role in the uncontrolled growth of adult T-cell leukemia cells . Two patients with Tac-positive adult T-cell leukemia have been treated with the anti-Tac . One of the patients had 6- and 3-mo remissions of his leukemia following two courses of therapy with this monoclonal antibody directed toward this growth factor receptor .",gene
"Lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor binding in depressed patients with hypercortisolemia . Despite elevated levels of serum and urinary cortisol , patients with depressive illness manifest none of the clinical stigmata of glucocorticoid excess . This hypercortisolemia in the absence of clinical effects suggests a state of hormone resistance and could be mediated by alterations in the glucocorticoid receptor . Earlier studies have shown that small doses of glucocorticoids cause a decrease in glucocorticoid receptor binding in normal human lymphocytes . White cells from depressed patients with significant hypercortisolemia would be expected to show a similar change in receptor concentration if peripheral tissues are adequately exposed to and sensitive to the hormone . In this study we compared the binding of [ 3H ] dexamethasone to lymphocytes from normal subjects and depressed patients with hypercortisolemia . Lymphocytes from normal subjects had a mean receptor concentration of 10.2 +/- 0.66 fm/10 ( 6 ) cells ( S.E.M. ) and a dissociation constant of 4.8 +/- 0.47 nM . Lymphocytes from depressed patients with abnormal 0800 h serum cortisol after dexamethasone had a mean receptor concentration of 8.8 +/- 0.75 fm/10 ( 6 ) cells , which was not significantly different from that in lymphocytes from normal subjects or from depressed subjects with normal post-dexamethasone cortisol levels ( 9.4 +/- 0.95 fm/10 ( 6 ) cells ) . Lymphocytes from depressed patients with elevated urinary free cortisol excretion ( UFC ) also had normal receptor concentration and binding affinity for dexamethasone . The lack of a change in lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor concentration in the presence of cortisol excess suggests the possibility that hypercortisolemia in depressive illness represents a state of peripheral glucocorticoid resistance .",gene
"Structure and regulation of the glucocorticoid hormone receptor . The glucocorticoid receptor is an intracellular protein which possesses three distinct domains , one that binds agonist and antagonist steroids , one that binds DNA , and one that binds anti-receptor antibodies and is required for glucocorticoid modulation of gene expression . In intact cells , receptor number , affinity and activity can change in response to factors that bind to the receptor , or that act indirectly through ill-defined mechanisms which may include resumption or arrest of cell cycling and variations in intracellular calcium ion concentrations . Some of these factors appear to exert their effect by controlling critical receptor properties such as ATP-dependent phosphorylation , integrity of thiol groups , and exposure of key amino acid residues . Glucocorticoid agonists promote the 'transformation ' of the receptor into the DNA-binding state , which is competent for modulating gene expression . Glucocorticoid antagonists are steroids that interact with the receptor but either fail to produce a stable complex or produce a stable but inefficient complex . Although substituent groups that confer agonist or antagonist activity to the steroid have been identified , the molecular determinants of this difference at the receptor level remain unknown . Most in vitro and in vivo data on receptor regulation can be accommodated by postulating the existence of an intracellular cycle that involves five states of the receptor . The active free receptor is phosphorylated , reduced , and presumably oligomeric ( state A ) . Following binding of an agonist ( state B ) , it can become transformed by dissociation into its subunits and dephosphorylation ( state C ) . The transformed receptor then interacts with chromatin ( state D ) . Dissociation of the steroid and oxidation of receptor thiol group ( s ) lead to the inactive receptor form ( state E ) . Reduction and rephosphorylation of the receptor enable it to bind steroids again so that the cycle is closed .",gene
"Thermodynamics of steroid binding to the human glucocorticoid receptor . The thermodynamics of the interaction of glucocorticoids with their receptor were studied in cytosol from human lymphoblastoid cells . The rate and affinity constants of dexamethasone and cortisol between 0 degree and 25 degrees C were calculated by curve-fitting from time-course and equilibrium kinetics . The data were consistent with a simple reversible bimolecular interaction . Arrhenius and Va n't Hoff plots were curvilinear for both steroids . At equilibrium , the solution for the equation delta G = delta H - T X delta S ( eqn. 1 ) was ( in kJ X mol-1 ) -47 = 36 - 83 ( dexamethasone ) and -42 = -9 - 33 ( cortisol ) at 0 degree C . Enthalpy and entropy changes decreased quasi-linearly with temperature such that , at 25 degrees C , the respective values were -50 = -75 + 25 and -43 = -48 + 5 . Thus , for both steroids , the interaction was entropy-driven at low temperature and became entirely enthalpy-driven at 20 degrees C . Thermodynamic values for the transition state were calculated from the rate constants . For the forward reaction , eqn. ( 1 ) gave 45 = 84 - 39 ( dexamethasone ) and 46 = 60 - 14 ( cortisol ) at 0 degree C , and 44 = 24 + 20 ( dexamethasone ) and 46 = 28 + 18 ( cortisol ) at 25 degrees C . These data fit quite well with a two-step model [ Ross & Subramanian ( 1981 ) Biochemistry 20 , 3096-3102 ] proposed for ligand-protein interactions , which involves a partial immobilization of the reacting species governed by hydrophobic forces , followed by stabilization of the complex by short-range interactions . On the basis of this model , an analysis of the transition-state thermodynamics led to the conclusion that no more than half of the steroid molecular area is engaged in the binding process .",gene
"Cell cycle-related changes in number of T-lymphocyte receptors for glucocorticoids and insulin . Enriched human peripheral T-lymphocytes were stimulated with PHA and examined for variations in insulin and glucocorticoid ( dexamethasone ) receptor numbers during the early phases of the cell cycle . Cells in G0 , G1a and G1b phases , where the G1a - G1b transition is an Interleukin 2 dependent event , were quantitated by flow cytometry . Few but significant numbers of glucocorticoid receptors ( 2700/cell ) and no insulin receptors ( -1/cell ) were found in the resting ( G0 ) phase . As cells entered the G1a phase the specific binding of dexamethasone increased and of insulin took place . Although the specific binding further increased as T-cells entered the G1b phase ( as measured at 44 h of incubation and using hydroxyurea-treated cells ) , the major changes in the specific binding of dexamethasone took place during the period 16 - 20 h after stimulation . Based on these findings , it is concluded that both receptor types ( cell membrane and cytoplasmic receptors ) are being formed and increased at G1 phase prior to cell proliferation , indicating the importance of G1 phase in immunoregulation .",gene
"Glucocorticoid receptors and cortico-sensitivity in a human clonal monocytic cell line , CM-SM . CM-SM is a clonal line of human precursor mononuclear phagocytes inducible to macrophage differentiation in response to the tumor promoter phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) . Untreated CM-SM cells contain single class , high-affinity ( KD = 4.0 X 10 ( -9 ) M ) glucocorticoid-specific receptor sites ( approximately 60 , 000 per cell ) , as measured by a whole cell assay , at 37 degrees C , using [ 3H ] triamcinolone acetonide ( TA ) . Exposure of CM-SM to dexamethasone ( DEX ) produced a progressive , dose- and time-related series of changes in CM-SM cell growth , saturation density , morphology , and functional properties , with half-maximal effects at about 10 ( -9 ) M for DEX . TA-receptor sites rapidly decreased ( about 70 % ) after DEX treatment , without any apparent change in steroid specificity and affinity . After 5 days in culture with a saturating concentration ( 3.6 X 10 ( -8 ) M ) of hormone , the cells reached a saturation density of about 9.0 X 10 ( 6 ) viable cells/ml ( about 4.0 X 10 ( 6 ) viable cells/ml in the controls ) , while the modal volume of the resulting cell population was approximately 60 % , as compared to the volume of untreated cells . DEX-treated cells appeared less differentiated than controls , as assessed by combined morphologic , antigenic , and cytoenzymatic analyses . DEX almost completely inhibited TPA activation of the following macrophage functions : adherency to the culture plate , expression of lysosomal enzymes , Fc and C3 receptors , and stimulation of phagocytosis . After removal of DEX , the cells , within a few passages , returned to a state apparently identical to the untreated controls and could be induced to macrophage differentiation in response to TPA .",gene
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children : current status , controversies , and future perspective . Disease-free survival ( DFS ) in childhood ALL is 60 % , and survival in good , average , and poor prognostic groups defined by initial WBC and age is 90 , 60 , and 45 % , respectively . Additional immunological , morphological , biochemical , cytokinetic , and cytogenetic factors have been identified , illustrating the heterogeneity of ALL and its derivation from malignant clones at various stages of differentiation and with varying rates of proliferation . Of biologic importance , these factors may refine further the characteristic features of clinically-determined prognostic groups . Multivariate analysis of large prospective trials with homogeneous therapy will be required to determine the independent prognostic importance of these factors . Current treatment strategies in ALL include ( 1 ) tailoring therapy and its intensity to prognostic groups ; ( 2 ) multiple-drug combinations in induction ; ( 3 ) early use of intrathecal ( IT ) methotrexate ( MTX ) ; ( 4 ) CNS prophylaxis with IT MTX alone in good prognosis patients and combined cranial radiation ( CXRT ) , 1800 rads plus IT MTX , in average and poor prognosis patients . Current studies show a CNS relapse rate of 5 % in all prognostic groups . Late neuropsychological defects caused by cranial XRT and IT MTX have prompted programs designed to reduce the potential late toxicity of CNS prophylaxis . More pronounced in younger children , these abnormalities include decreased IQ , visual-motor incoordination , poor performance in mathematics , and memory dysfunction .

"Glucocorticoid receptor and in vitro sensitivity to steroid hormones in human lymphoproliferative diseases and myeloid leukemia . The glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) quantitation by a whole-cell assay and/or cytosol technique and the in vitro sensitivity to steroids have been assessed in peripheral blood cells from normal donors and patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia ( CLL ) , acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , lymphosarcoma cell leukemia ( LSCL ) , acute nonlymphatic leukemia ( ANLL ) , and chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . Within the lymphoproliferative diseases , ALL cells exhibited the highest GR concentration ( regardless of the method used ) and the highest in vitro inhibition of spontaneous [ 3H ] thymidine ( [ 3H ] TdR ) uptake by glucocorticoids . A significant relationship between GR concentration ( whole-cell assay ) and in vitro sensitivity to dexamethasone was also found . On the contrary , CLL cells presented the highest sensitivity to glucocorticoids in PHA-stimulated cell cultures . Cells from the only two ALL patients who did not undergo a remission after glucocorticoid-inclusive chemotherapy had both the lowest in vitro sensitivity to dexamethasone and the lowest GR concentration with whole-cell assay . Concerning myeloid leukemia , ANLL patients had GR concentrations slightly higher than those found in the ALL group but exhibited the lowest degree of inhibition of spontaneous [ 3H ] TdR uptake by dexamethasone ( stimulatory effects occurred in some cases ) . CML cells exhibited an inhibition degree by in vitro glucocorticoids significantly higher than that of ANLL cells but not different from that of lymphoproliferative diseases .

"Glucocorticoid receptors and in vitro corticosensitivity of peanut-positive and peanut-negative human thymocyte subpopulations . In 6 human thymus glands , the immature subset of thymocytes was separated from the more mature one , by differential peanut lectin agglutination . These 2 cell subpopulations were analyzed for glucocorticoid receptor content by using a whole cell assay , with ( 3H ) -triamcinolone acetonide as tracer . The unagglutinated thymocytes ( peanut negative ) contained about 2 times more receptor sites per cell than agglutinated ( peanut positive ) ones ( 7650 +/- 1550 S.D. verus 3195 +/- 896 S.D. ) . The affinity for steroid was similar in both cell subsets , as was the stereospecificity for glucocorticoids , the time-course of steroid-receptor association , and cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation . Despite the greater number of glucocorticoid receptor sites , the peanut-negative thymocyte subpopulation did not differ from the peanut-positive one in its sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of triamcinolone acetonide , as determined by measurements of the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors of protein and DNA . Moreover , the peanut-negative subset appeared more resistant in vitro to the steroid-induced cell lysis as compared to the peanut-positive one . Thus , our data suggest that glucocorticoid receptor density and corticosensitivity are not directly correlated and that the number of glucocorticoid receptor sites may be dependent on the degree of immunologic maturation",gene
"Defective binding and function of 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors in peripheral mononuclear cells of patients with end-organ resistance to 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D . Lectin-induced DNA synthesis by peripheral mononuclear cells from 17 normal donors was inhibited ( 40-60 % ) by 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 , 25 [ OH ] 2D3 ) at physiological concentrations ( 10 ( -10 ) -10 ( -9 ) M ) . The lymphocytes acquire specific receptors for 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 upon activation by the lectins . This process precedes the inhibitory effect of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 . We studied lymphocytes from six patients from four different kindreds with the syndrome of hereditary end-organ resistance to 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D ( the so-called vitamin D-dependent rickets type II ) . In five patients ( three kindreds ) peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not acquire receptors for 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 upon phytohemagglutinin-induced activation . Moreover , in contrast to normal lymphocytes , the mitogenic stimulation of these patients ' lymphocytes by phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A was not inhibited by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 . Activated lymphocytes of the sixth patient from a fourth kindred exhibited normal binding of [ 3H ] 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 but the hormone failed to inhibit the mitogenic stimulation . A similar pattern of the vitamin D effector system was previously observed in fibroblasts cultured from skin biopsies of the same group of patients . The conclusions from these findings are : ( a ) the inhibition of mitogenic stimulation by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 is mediated by specific functional receptors to the hormone ; and ( b ) the receptors for 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 in mononuclear cells are probably controlled genetically by the same mechanisms as the effector system in well-characterized target organs of the hormone , such as intestine and kidney .",gene

"Immunological interference of high dose corticosteroids . High-dose corticosteroids ( HDC ) will influence cellular as well as humoral participants of the immune response . The lymphoid tissue will decrease in size and weight after prolonged treatment with HDC . Lymphocyte functions will be impaired . Reduced synthesis of B- as well as T-lymphocytes will be seen . The inhibitory effect on B-cell function can be observed both as decreased serum levels of immunoglobulins and as impaired binding of antibodies and complement to the cellular surface . Reduced T-cell function indicated by impaired stimulation by PHA and porkweed as well as by impaired lymphokinin effects on leukocyte migration inhibition has been reported . Reduced lymphocyte adherence to antigen and suppressed lymphocyte reaction have also been observed . Humoral factors involved in chemotaxis , opsonisation , phagocytosis , vascular permeability leading to leakage of fluid and cells and factors involved in lysis of antigens are impaired . This can be explained partly by the observed reduced complement activation via the alternative as well as the classical pathway in association with HDC therapy . Acute processes with increased vascular permeability and accumulation of leukocytes as impairing factors could be influenced beneficially by HDC therapy . This positive effect can be seen in treatment of septic shock or rejection of a transplant .

"Identification of human leukemic glucocorticoid receptors using affinity labeling and anti-human glucocorticoid receptor antibodies . Antisera raised against human lymphoid glucocorticoid receptors were used in combination with the glucocorticoid receptor affinity label [ 3H ] dexamethasone 21-mesylate [ ( 3H ] DM ) to identify the glucocorticoid receptors of the human B-lymphoblastoid cell line IM-9 and the human T-cell leukemic cell line CEM-C7 . Antisera were obtained following immunization of New Zealand White rabbits with [ 3H ] triamcinolone acetonide [ ( 3H ] TA ) -glucocorticoid receptor complexes partially purified by two-stage DNA-cellulose chromatography . The presence of anti-human glucocorticoid receptor antibodies was verified by : ( a ) adsorption of [ 3H ] TA-receptor-antibody complexes to Protein A ; ( b ) a shift to higher apparent molecular weight in the elution position from Sephacryl S300 of [ 3H ] TA-receptor complexes incubated with immune serum ; and ( c ) the ability of immune serum to displace [ 3H ] TA-receptor complexes on sucrose gradients . These antibodies also recognized rat liver and murine S49 cell glucocorticoid receptors . Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [ 3H ] DM-labeled IM-9 cytosol identified a major competable band with a molecular weight of approximately 90 , 000 , three minor competable components with molecular weights of approximately 78 , 000 , approximately 51 , 000 , and approximately 38 , 500 , and at least 21 other noncompetable components . Following immunoprecipitation of [ 3H ] DM-labeled cytosol with immune serum , only the Mr 90 , 000 and 78 , 000 components were seen .

Thus , the combination of affinity labeling and anti-human glucocorticoid receptor antibodies is capable of providing direct physical identification of human lymphoid glucocorticoid receptors .",gene
"Effect of thymosin on glucocorticoid receptor activity and glucocorticoid sensitivity of human thymocytes . Incubation with thymosin fraction 5 , ( TMS F5 at 300 micrograms/ml ) a partially purified thymic factor , reduced the steroid binding activity of human infant thymocytes from 9.6 +/- 2.1 fmole/ml to 5.0 +/- 2.0 fmole/ml . The glucocorticoid receptor activity in normal infant thymocytes was found to be 2 , 146 +/- 726 ( s.d. ) sites per cell with dissociation constant of 1.4 +/- 0.6 X 10 ( -8 ) M . TMS F5 also increased the resistance of human thymocytes to the cytolytic effect of dexamethasone ( 2.5 X 10 ( -8 ) M ) to 168.6 +/- 30.2 % of control ( P less than 0.01 ) . In animals , medullary and peripheral blood T cells are more resistant to glucocorticoids than immature thymic T cells . The results show that thymosin can induce changes consistent with differentiation in human thymocytes . These in vitro results are consistent with a physiological role of thymosin in intrathymic T cell maturation in man . Incubation of a human malignant thymus derived T cell line ( MOLT 3 ) with TMS F5 also resulted in a significant reduction of the number of steroid binding sites to 44.2 +/- 15.3 % of control ( P less than 0.05 ) , but TMS F5 did not significantly reduce the glucocorticoid sensitivity of MOLT 3 cells .",gene

"Effects of chronic glucocorticoid excess in man on insulin binding to circulating cells : differences between endogenous and exogenous hypercorticism . We measured [ 125I ] insulin binding to circulating monocytes or erythrocytes from 16 patients with chronic glucocorticoid excess , 9 chronically treated with prednisone and 7 with adrenocortical hyperfunction . With monocytes , [ 125I ] insulin binding was iincreased in all patients . Analysis of binding data indicated that increased binding in patients treated with prednisone was due to an ncrease in receptor concentration , whereas in patients with adrenocortical hyperfunction , it was due to an increase in receptor affinity . With erythrocytes from patients with adrenocortical hyperfunction there was an increase in receptor affinity and a decrease in receptor concentration , so that the binding of [ 125I ] insulin was normal . The disparity of results between endogenous and exogenous hypercorticism , between the two cell types , and between the present studies and previous studies suggest that the effects of glucocorticoid excess on the insulin receptor are extremely complex and wide-ranging and that in this condition , extrapolations in humans from data with circulating cells to liver and muscle may not be appropriate .",gene

The administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone , 5 mg of prednisone , and 37.5 mg of cortisone acetate resulted in a 30 % decrease in binding sites after 1 week with no change in binding affinity . No changes in the number of binding sites was noted before 1 week and the diminished number persisted for 1 week after discontinuation of glucocorticoid treatment . Lymphocytes from hospitalized patients taking 40-60 mg of dexamethasone daily demonstrated the same change in number of binding sites that was seen in normal subjects taking 1 mg of dexamethasone . When binding assays were carried out at physiologic temperature there was the same decrease in number of binding sites after dexamethasone administration , and in addition , there was a two-fold increase in binding affinity . Glucocorticoid administration results in a time-dependent decrease in the number of lymphocyte glucocorticoid binding sites that is independent of the type of glucocorticoid administered . This is the first in vivo demonstration that glucocorticoids modulate their own receptors in man .",gene
"Immunoglobulin localization in benign and malignant lesions of the human mammary gland . Using direct imunofluorescence , lesions from 266 human breast specimens were studied for the presence of IgA , IgM , or IgG localization . The lesions included benign elements from 66 subcutaneous mastectomy specimens in which the absence of simultaneous breast malignancy was documented , primary breast carcinomas from 153 mastectomy specimens , and 47 biopsies containing metastatic breast cancer . A statistically significant association of IgA and IgM with benign lesions was contrasted to the association of IgG with malignant lesions . In both primary and metastatic lesions , IgG localization was associated with estrogen-receptor-poor primary cancers as compared with estrogen-receptor-rich primary cancers . Among primary breast cancer patients , IgG localization in the tumor correlated with relative lymphopenia . A shorter disease-free interval was noted in association with IgG localization among the metastatic breast lesions . No statistically significant association between stage of disease and immunoglobulin presence was demonstrable . Moderate-to-severe intraductal epithelial hyperplasias were more often associated with immunoglobulin G localization that were other benign lesions",gene
"Correlation of steroid receptors with histologic differentiation in mammary carcinoma . A Singapore experience . Cancer of the breast is the most common tumor in females in Singapore , with the rate of 20.7 per 100 , 000 per year ( 1977 estimate ) , which is predicted to increase to 29.8 per 100 , 000 women per year by 1995 . A detailed histopathologic review of 50 primary breast cancer tumors analyzed for estrogen receptor ( ER ) level was carried out and a variety of morphologic features correlated with ER results to identify any factors that will improve the management and prognosis for breast cancer . Cytosol was incubated with 3H-estradiol in the presence and absence of cold diethylstilbestrol , and bound and free hormone were separated by Dextran-coated charcoal method . Tumors binding more than 5 fmol/mg cytosol protein were classified as ER -positive . Progesterone receptor ( PR ) level was analyzed in some specimens with the use of a similar method . Most of the patients were Chinese ( 90 % ) . Three patients were Malays , one was Indian , and one was European in this series . Results indicated that there was strong correlation between ER level , age , and histologic grade of the tumors . No correlation existed between absence or presence of lymph node metastases and ER . Although there was a trend for ER -positive tumors to have a low-grade lymphocytic infiltration , the difference was not statistically significant .",gene
"Mononuclear cells infiltrating human mammary carcinomas : immunohistochemical analysis with monoclonal antibodies . Breast carcinomas were examined by the immunoperoxidase technique using antisera specific for lymphocyte subsets , monocytes , NK cells and major histocompatibility antigens ( HLA-A , -B , -C ; Ia-like ) . Sixty-four per cent of the patients had a moderate or strong mononuclear cell infiltration , 77 % of the patients without mononuclear cell infiltration had receptors for estrogens as compared to 51 % of the patients with infiltration . The majority of the infiltrating mononuclear cells were T cells ; generally the OKT8 cells were predominant . The Leu 3A/OKT8 cell ratio was not related to histological type , tumor size , age of the patient or presence of metastases . Some of the T cells had the Ia antigen and were thus probably activated . The B cells were either absent or less numerous than the T cells . There was no relation between their distribution and the various parameters studied . A few monocytes were heterogeneous according to their markers ( OKM I and acid phosphatase ) . In 6 cases only there was a strong infiltration of mononuclear cells positive for acid phosphatase . The number of the natural killer cells was also low . Only a few mononuclear infiltrating cells had receptors for transferrin . There was a positive correlation between the inflammatory infiltration and the presence of HLA class-I antigens on tumor cell s . Some of the antisera specific for lymphocyte subsets also stained the breast carcinoma cells . The great variations in the subsets of mononuclear cells in breast carcinomas may correspond to various systems of defense against neoplasm .",gene

A study of the receptors for dihydrotestosterone in fibroblasts of genital and nongenital skin showed a normal concentration of receptors in genital skin ; 5-alpha-reductase activity in fibroblasts of the genital skin was low , but the plasma relationship testosterone/dihydrotestosterone under HCG stimulation was normal .

"1 , 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibits antigen-induced T cell activation . The proliferative response of murine spleen and thymus cells to antigen but not to lectin was inhibited by the active metabolite of vitamin D3 , 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 . To directly examine the effect of 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 on T cell activation in the absence of other complicating interactions , we utilized a panel of cloned Ia-restricted T cell hybridomas that secrete IL 2 on activation by cloned Ia-bearing stimulator cells ( TA3 ) or when stimulated by mitogen . Physiologic concentrations of 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 ( 0.01 to 0.1 nm ) inhibited the antigen-induced secretion of IL 2 by several of these T cell hybridomas . This inhibition was dependent on the concentration of the free hormone and could be overcome by increasing the number of Ia-bearing stimulator cells used . Pretreatment of the T hybridoma but not the TA3 stimulator cell with 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 resulted in inhibition of activation . These results are consistent with the finding that specific 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 receptors are present on the T cell hybridomas but are lacking in TA3 cells . 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 failed , however , to inhibit the activation of the T cell hybridomas by lectin or by an anti-Thy-1 antibody . These findings suggest that 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 may be interfering with early events of antigen-induced T cell activation , perhaps by hindering T cell recognition of the relevant antigen on stimulator cell surfaces . This system should prove useful in studying the molecular mechanisms by which 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 acts to inhibit T cell activation and subsequent IL 2 production .",gene
"Glucocorticoid receptors and steroid sensitivity in normal and neoplastic human lymphoid tissues : a review . The determination of estrogen and progesterone receptors in breast cancer has been shown to be useful in predicting the response to endocrine therapy . Given their well-known inhibitory effects on lymphoid tissue , glucocorticoids have been used widely in the treatment of leukemia . Given these facts , over the last 10 years , several investigators have measured the number of glucocorticoid receptors in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissue to see whether their number correlated with glucocorticoid responsiveness in vitro or in vivo . No clear correlation could be established between the level of glucocorticoid receptor and the in vitro action of steroids in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissue . In contrast , attempts to correlate glucocorticoid receptor levels in acute lymphocytic leukemia to in vivo steroid responsiveness and immunological type using the whole-cell-binding assay for receptor determination and selecting the patients according to age and immunological criteria have been more successful .",gene

Human lymphocytes are an adequate object for studying genetically determined variability of GC receptors and its clinical importance .,gene
"Specific estrogen binding sites in human lymphoid cells and thymic cells . The binding of estrogen in preparations of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells , as well as by splenic and thymic cells is demonstrated by three different approaches ( Dextran-coated charcoal method , whole cell assay , and gel filtration on a sepharose 4B column ) . Scatchard 's analysis of [ 3H ] -moxestrol ( R2858 ) and [ 3H ] -estradiol binding proves the existence of a single class of receptor sites having a dissociation constant of 0.18-2.4 X 10 ( -9 ) M .

"Administration of fibroblast interferon to patients with advanced breast cancer : possible effects on skin metastasis and on hormone receptors . Eleven patients with metastasized breast cancer received 8 intramuscular injections of 6 x 10 ( 6 ) units of human fibroblast interferon over a period of 40 days . The injections did not cause local irritation or inflammation . Fever occurred in only 1 of the 11 patients . Although several types of metastases were monitored , only skin nodules consistently ( 10 out of 11 patients ) exhibited changes that were suggestive of a therapeutic effect of the treatment regimen : either a simple decrease in size of some nodules or central necrosis accompanied by an inflammatory reaction . NK-activity of peripheral blood leukocytes was significantly increased after administration of the first dose ; the effect of subsequent injections was less clear . Receptors for estrogens and progestogens were increased in the tumor biopsies of 2 out of 2 and 5 out of 6 patients tested respectively .",gene
"Decreased glucocorticoid receptor binding in adrenal insufficiency . To examine the effect of glucocorticoid deficiency on the glucocorticoid receptor , we examine the binding of [ 3H ] dexamethasone to lymphocytes in normal subjects and patients with adrenal insufficiency before and after glucocorticoid replacement therapy . Using a whole cell competitive binding assay , normal human lymphocytes had 5977 +/- 1487 ( mean +/- SD ) binding sites/cell and a dissociation constant of 10 +/- 2 nM . Lymphocytes from patients with untreated adrenal insufficiency had fewer binding sites ( 3364 +/-322 ) and a 2-fold increase in binding affinity ( 5.4 +/- 0.9 mM ) . The administration of conventional replacement doses of cortisone acetate for 6 months caused no change in receptor number , but was associated with a decrease in binding affinity toward normal . After long term glucocorticoid replacement therapy , binding parameters were similar to those in patients before treatment . The physiological implications of the decreased receptor number and increased binding affinity in adrenal insufficiency remain to be elucidated .",gene
"Glucocorticoid receptor concentrations and terminal transferase activity as indicators of prognosis in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia . Activity of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( TdT ) , adenosine deaminase , and 5'nucleotidase and the cellular concentration of glucocorticoid ( dexamethasone ) receptor were determined in 25 patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia . All patients were treated according to a common protocol . Increased activity of TdT ( greater than 0.1 unit/microgram DNA ) was found in 11 patients . This group of patients was shown to have higher remission and survival rates ( p = 0.06 ) compared with patients with low activity of TdT . The glucocorticoid receptor concentration of the leukaemic blast cells ranged from 0 to 0.94 fmol/microgram DNA . Thirteen patients had blast cells with a glucocorticoid receptor concentration over 0.22 fmol/microgram DNA . These patients had significantly increased remission and survival rates ( p = 0.006 ) compared with those with a low receptor concentration . This finding can not be explained by a difference in sensitivity to glucocorticoids since these were not used as therapeutic agents . Adenosine deaminase and 5'nucleotidase activities both varied within two orders of magnitude . No correlation could be found between activities of these enzymes and remission or survival rate . These results show that measurements of TdT activity and the glucocorticoid receptor concentration yield valuable prognostic information in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia",gene
"[ 3H ] cortivazol : a unique high affinity ligand for the glucocorticoid receptor . Cortivazol ( CVZ ) and deacylcortivazol ( DAC ) are pyrazolosteroids with potent glucocorticoid activity . In previous work we showed that DAC is 40-fold more potent than dexamethasone ( DEX ) in lysing leukemic lymphoblasts . To assess the interaction between these atypical steroids and the glucocorticoid receptor , we examined the binding of [ 3H ] CVZ to cytosol from glucocorticoid-sensitive and -resistant variants of the human leukemic cell line CEM C7 . In glucocorticoid-sensitive cells [ 3H ] CVZ causes a 2-fold induction of glutamine synthetase and binds to a protein in the 4.6 S region of high salt sucrose gradients . On DEAE-cellulose chromatography , [ 3H ] CVZ-receptor complexes show a shift from high ( 0.25 M KP ) to low salt ( 0.09 M KP ) eluting forms upon activation . CVZ competes for a 97 , 000-dalton protein labeled by [ 3H ] dexamethasone mesylate . Scatchard analysis of the binding of [ 3H ] CVZ in glucocorticoid-sensitive cells revealed a curvilinear plot which resolved into high ( 0.4 nM ) and low ( 11 nM ) affinity components . The receptor concentration of the low affinity site ( 0.30 pmol/mg protein ) was approximately twice that of the high affinity site ( 0.14 pmol/mg protein ) . Dissociation experiments with dilution and/or excess unlabeled CVZ supported the presence of independent sites . In contrast , the binding of [ 3H ] DEX to C7 cytosol revealed a single class of binding sites ( Kd = 1.9 nM ; receptor concentration , 0.46 pmol/mg protein ) . Examination of the binding of [ 3H ] CVZ using 10 ( -5 ) M DEX as the competing ligand showed that DEX binds only to the low affinity site detected by [",gene

"A controlled pore glass bead assay for the measurement of cytoplasmic and nuclear glucocorticoid receptors . An assay for the quantitation of cytoplasmic and nuclear glucocorticoid receptors in lymphoid tissue has been developed using controlled pore glass ( CPG ) beads . Soluble receptor -- 3H-steroid complex ( cytosol or nuclear extract ) is adsorbed quantitatively within the crevasses of porous glass beads . Excess labeled steroid as well as most non-specifically bound steroid is easily washed away , leaving the hormone-receptor complex retained by the beads . Bound 3H-steroid is eluted with ethanol and measured for radioactivity . This procedure which is simple , rapid , and highly reproducible is carried out using frozen samples ( stable for many months ) containing as few as 1 X 10 ( 7 ) cells . A comparison of the CPG assay to dextran coated charcoal and a whole cell assay demonstrates that CPG and dextran coated charcoal give equivalent measurements of cytosolic receptor concentration , while the CPG and whole cell assays provide equivalent values for total receptor content .",gene
"Plasmacytoid blast crisis in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia : effect of estradiol on growth and differentiation in vitro . Evolution of a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) into blast crisis was found to be characterized by three unusual features ( 1 ) the phenotype of the emerging blast cells was that of pre-plasmacytoid cells as shown by plasma cell morphology and an immunological phenotype corresponding partially with CLL- or intermediate B-cells , partially with plasma cells ( terminal transferase - , common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen - , Ia+ , surface immunoglobulin heavy chains - , surface kappa light chains + , intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin A+ and G+ , BA-1+ , polyclonal gammaglobulin production ) ; ( 2 ) cytogenetic analysis of spontaneous metaphases revealed that in addition to the typical CLL abnormality , trisomy 12 , in all of the cells , an additional translocation between chromosomes 14 and 17 was present in 40 % with a presumptive breakpoint on chromosome 14 ( q12-3 ) never described before ( commonly q32 ) and ( 3 ) the progression of the disease was associated with a striking increase in the expression by the transformed cells of specific binding sites for estradiol ( E2 ) due to an actual increase in total cellular receptor proteins and not to a change in receptor affinity for E2 . The functional status of the steroid receptors was confirmed by nuclear transfer of the cytoplasmic hormone-receptor complex upon temperature activation . Since the rise in E2-receptor display paralleled a large increase in the proliferative activity of the cells as well as a change in their maturation status the question was raised as to whether the E2-receptor should be considered as a physiological marker of growth rate or of cellular differentiation . Exposure of the patient 's blast cells to E2 in vitro resulted in cessation of cell growth following at least one mitosis after addition of the inducer as seen from the replacement of the large blasts by small CLL-like cells without definite signs of alteration of the differentiation status . This suggests the association of E2-receptor expression with control of growth rather than cell maturation .",gene
"Multiple forms and fragments of cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors from human leukemic cells and normal lymphocytes . Therapy with glucocorticoids is generally more effective in acute lymphoblastic leukemia than in other types of human leukemia . Previous studies , however , have not revealed any consistent relationship between clinical responsiveness and the cellular or cytosolic concentration of glucocorticoid-binding sites . The objectives of this study were to determine whether there are intrinsic structural differences among the glucocorticoid receptors in various types of leukemic cells and normal lymphocytes and to investigate the role of endogenous peptidases in receptor degradation . Cytosols were prepared from fresh or rapidly frozen leukocytes from 6 healthy adults and 35 high-risk leukemia patients ( median white blood cell count , 150 , 000 cells/microliter ; median age , 13 years ) . Receptors were labeled with [ 3H ] triamcinolone acetonide and quantitated by charcoal-dextran treatment or Sephadex LH-20 chromatography . Mean and median cytosolic receptor concentrations in 12 acute lymphoblastic leukemia specimens lacking the standard B-cell or T-cell markers ( `` O cells '' ) were approximately 4-fold higher than in 23 other leukemic cell specimens . No other consistent differences in receptor content were observed . Agarose filtration and ultracentrifugation in hypotonic buffers containing 20 mM Na2MoO4 revealed complexes of similar size and shape in all clinical specimens tested and two established leukemic cell lines . They had Stokes radii ( Rs ) of 8.1 +/- 0.5 ( S.D. ) nm ( n = 50 ) , sedimentation coefficients of 9.5 +/- 0.3S ( n = 40 ) , molecular weights of approximately 330 , 000 , and axial ratios ( a/b ) of approximately 12 . In hypertonic , molybdate-free buffer , these oligomeric complexes were dissociated into subunits with Rs of 5.9 +/- 0.3 nm ( n = 12 ) and a/b of 11 to 12 , as observed previously for other receptors .

"Glucocorticoid receptor number and intracellular water space . In order to elucidate the relationship between cell water content and number of glucocorticoid receptors , eleven normal and malignant lymphoid or myelomonocytic cell types originating from mouse , rat and man were investigated . The cellular water space was measured with 3H2O , and glucocorticoid receptor number was measured in a whole-cell binding assay with [ 3H ] dexamethasone at 30 and 37 degrees C . The intracellular water phase concentration of glucocorticoid receptors ( around 40 nmol/l cell water ) , and the dependence of receptor affinity on temperature were similar in normal and malignant rodent and human cells . It is concluded that comparisons of glucocorticoid receptor levels are best made on the basis of intracellular receptor concentrations .",gene
"Covalent labeling of rat thymocyte and human lymphoid glucocorticoid receptor . Lymphoid cells contain specific receptors for glucocorticoids . We have used [ 3H ] dexamethasone-21-mesylate to label covalently glucocorticoid receptors in rat thymic lymphocytes and in neoplastic cells obtained from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and malignant lymphoma . The covalently labeled glucocorticoid receptors were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( in the presence of 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ) . In cytosolic fractions prepared from rat thymic lymphocytes , [ 3H ] -dexamethasone-21-mesylate labels a protein ( Mr approximately equal to 95 , 000 ) which was identified as the glucocorticoid receptor by the following criteria : ( a ) labeling of this moiety is inhibited by treatment with a 100-fold molar excess of glucocorticoids , such as dexamethasone and triamcinolone acetonide ; and ( b ) the covalently labeled Mr approximately equal to 95 , 000 protein is activated ( by heating at 20 degrees for 30 min ) to a form that binds to DNA-cellulose . When intact thymocytes are treated with [ 3H ] dexamethasone-21-mesylate , an Mr approximately equal to 95 , 000 moiety is also labeled covalently . Approximately 35 % of the glucocorticoid receptors can be labeled covalently when intact thymocytes are treated with 100 nM [ 3H ] dexamethasone-21-mesylate for 30 min at 4 degrees . Neoplastic cells from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and malignant lymphoma were treated with [ 3H ] dexamethasone-21-mesylate . In all samples , an Mr approximately equal to 95 , 000 moiety was labeled covalently ; labeling was inhibited by excess glucocorticoid . Smaller moieties were also identified by competition experiments ; these may represent proteolytic fragments of the Mr approximately equal to 95 , 000 receptor .

"The association of cytosol oestrogen and progesterone receptors with histological features of breast cancer and early recurrence of disease . Two hundred and eighty-eight primary breast tumours were examined for the presence or absence of oestrogen ( REc ) and progesterone ( RPc ) receptors . Analysis has shown a relative interdependence between the steroid receptor status of primary breast cancer and other prognostic variables such as histological grade , lymphocytic infiltration and tumour elastosis . There were significant associations between epithelial cellularity , stromal fibrosis and the value of REc in those tumours in which the receptor was present . Cellularity and fibrosis were unrelated to the presence or absence of oestrogen receptor . By contrast , neither the presence or absence nor the value of RPc could be related to cellularity or fibrosis . The value of REc and RPc analysis as an indicator of prognosis was examined in a sub-group of 175 patients receiving no additional treatment following mastectomy . Overall relapse-free survival ( RFS ) was no different for those patients with receptors compared to those without them ( REc P = 0.11 , RPc P = 0.7 ) . There was no difference in RFS of receptor positive and negative tumours when the axillary node status was taken into account .",gene
"Clinical implications of glucocorticoid receptors in human leukemia . Normal lymphoid cells contain glucocorticoid receptor . A variety of stimuli that activate these cells also induce increases in receptor concentration . Similar glucocorticoid receptors can be detected in lymphoid cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) .

Furthermore , in our hands , glucocorticoid receptor levels correlate with the duration of complete remission in ALL ( though not in other forms of leukemia ) . This association is independent of cell type , age , sex , or initial leukocyte count .

"Corticosteroid-mediated immunoregulation in man . Glucocorticoids have profound and complex effects on the human immune response . However , the precise mechanisms of the corticosteroid-induced immunoregulation in man have not been precisely defined . Intracytoplasmic corticosteroid-specific receptors appear to be an important common pathway for steroid-induced changes , but variations of receptor parameters do not account for the multifaceted effects on the immune system . Human circulating mononuclear cells redistribute out of the intravascular compartment following treatment with corticosteroids . Although certain components at this redistribution phenomenon have been well-characterized , the importance of this compartmental cellular shift with respect to the mechanisms of corticosteroid-induced immunoregulation are less well-defined . Recent observations that activated lymphocytes may be sensitive to the lytic effects of glucocorticoids suggest that under certain situations the elimination of selected subsets of cells may be a relevant mechanism of corticosteroid-mediated immunoregulation in man . Corticosteroid-mediated effects on monocyte function may be an important mechanism of drug-induced immunoregulation in monocyte-dependent responses . In some experimental conditions , corticosteroids inhibit Interleukin 1 production by monocytes . The immunoregulatory effects of corticosteroids on lymphocyte immune responses are complex . In vitro corticosteroids appear to selectively affect early immunoregulatory events as opposed to altering an established response .

"Human lymphoid cell lines and glucocorticoids : II . Whole cell and cytoplasmic binding properties of lymphoblastoid , leukaemia and lymphoma lines . The glucocorticoid binding properties of 18 human lymphoid cell lines ( HLCL ) have been investigated . The specificity of steroid binding was confirmed with various glucocorticoid agonists and antagonists . A gradation in whole cell and cytoplasmic glucocorticoid binding capacity was observed in the different cell line types : lymphoblastoid greater than lymphoma greater than leukaemia . The cytoplasmic receptors of leukaemia and lymphoblastoid lines appeared to contain both proteinaceous and phospholipid components . Cytoplasmic steroid-receptor complexes exhibited a wide range of sedimentation coefficients ( 8.5-11.3S ) in low ionic strength buffer but there was no correlation with cell line type or glucocorticoid sensitivity . Activation of these complexes by heat ( 37 degrees C ) or exposure to high ionic strength buffer ( 0.3 M NaCl ) induced nuclear binding of steroid but only complexes in high ionic strength buffer manifested changes in sedimentation coefficient . No correlation was observed between the level or nature of glucocorticoid binding and the cytolethal or cytostatic responsiveness of HLCL to glucocorticoid treatment in vitro . The resistance to cytolethal effects can not be ascribed to a failure of cells to take up and bind steroid or to significant differences in the molecular species of cytoplasmic receptors present .

"CD28 -mediated activation in CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ T cells : enhanced levels of reactive oxygen intermediates and c-Rel nuclear translocation in CD45RA+ cells . We have analyzed the effect of complete T cell activation ( anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 ) on the activation of NF-kappaB in CD45RA+ ( naive ) and CD45RO+ ( memory/effector ) T cells . Long exposure ( 24 h ) induced stronger NF-kappaB DNA binding in CD45RA+ cells than in CD45RO+ cells . Analysis of the nuclear c-Rel protein indicated that after anti-CD3+anti-CD28 stimulation the level of c-Rel was higher in CD45RA+ cells . Analysis of the cytoplasmic inhibitor IkappaBalpha indicated that anti-CD3+anti-CD28 stimulation induced a long-lasting degradation in CD45RA+ cells but in CD45RO+ cells the degradation process was more rapid . Because the CD28 costimulus is known to induce the production of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) , the intracellular ROI levels in CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ cells were compared by flow cytometry .

Studies on an Ikaros O mutation have revealed an essential role for this factor in lymphoid cell fate determination and at subsequent branch points of the T cell differentiation pathway . Differences in the phenotypes of a O and a dominant negative ( DN ) Ikaros mutation provide insight into a regulatory network through which Ikaros proteins exert their effects in development . In addition a comparative analysis of the hemopoietic stem cell and precursor compartment resulting from the two Ikaros mutations reveals a profound yet not absolute requirement for Ikaros in the production and differentiation of these populations .",gene
"Overexpression of p65 and c-Jun substitutes for B7-1 costimulation by targeting the CD28RE within the IL-2 promoter . The role of Rel and activation protein-1 ( AP-1 ) in IL-2 promoter activity in B7-1- and leukocyte function-associated Ag-3 ( LFA. 3 ) -costimulated T cells has been evaluated . We demonstrate that overexpression of c-Jun but not c-Fos increases IL-2 promoter activity in both B7-1- and LFA-3-costimulated Jurkat T cells . Cotransfection of both c-Jun and c-Fos substitutes for B7-1 costimulation in driving an activation protein-1 response element but not for the IL-2 promoter . Overexpression of Rel proteins demonstrated that p65-expressing Jurkat cells transcribed equally well a nuclear factor kappabeta reporter construct when costimulated with B7-1 or LFA-3 , but transcription of IL-2 promoter or CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) -driven reporters was superior in B7-1-costimulated cells . Combined expression of c-Jun and p65 induced vigorous transcription of IL-2 promoter- and CD28RE-driven reporter constructs in both LFA-3- and B7-1-costimulated Jurkat cells . Mutating the CD28RE but not the upstream nuclear factor kappabeta-binding site in the IL-2 promoter reduced B7-1 -driven transcription > 90 % . The results implicates a major role of the CD28RE in the integration of p65 / c-Jun -mediated transcription within the IL-2 promoter . We suggest that the transition from an autocrine LFA-3 -driven immune response to a B7 -- induced paracrine immune response involves the activation of c-Jun and p65 , which target the CD28RE region of the IL-2 promoter .",gene
"Defects in actin-cap formation in Vav-deficient mice implicate an actin requirement for lymphocyte signal transduction . BACKGROUND : Antigen-receptor interactions on lymphocytes result in local clustering of actin , receptors and signaling molecules into an asymmetric membrane structure termed a cap . Although actin polymerization is known to be required , the mechanisms underlying cap formation are unclear . We have studied the events underlying cap formation using mice bearing a O mutation in vav ( vav -/- ) , a gene that encodes a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for the GTPase Rac . RESULTS : Lymphocytes from vav -/- mice failed to form T-cell receptor caps following activation and had a defective actin cytoskeleton . The vav-/- T cells were deficient in interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) production and proliferation , and the peak of Ca2+ mobilization was reduced although of normal duration . Activation of Jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated kinase ( JNK or SAPK ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) and the induction of the transcription factor NF-ATc1 and egr-1 genes was normal . Despite the reduced Ca2+ mobilization , translocation of cytoplasmic NF-ATc to the nucleus was normal , reflecting that the lower levels of Ca2+ in vav-/- cells were still sufficient to activate calcineurin . Treatment of lymphocytes with cytochalasin D , which blocks actin polymerization , inhibited cap formation and produced defects in signaling and IL-2 transcriptional induction in response to antigen-receptor signaling that were nearly identical to those seen in vav-/- cells . In transfection studies , either constitutively active Vav or Rac could complement constitutively active calcineurin to activate NF-AT-dependent transcription . CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that Vav is required for cap formation in lymphocytes . Furthermore , the correlation between cap formation , IL-2 production and proliferation supports the hypothesis that an actin-dependent pathway is a source of specialized growth regulatory signals .",gene

To assess HUVEC activation , E-selectin expression was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , Northern blot analysis for E-selectin-specific mRNA , and electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) for NF-kappa B , a transcription factor necessary for E-selectin gene activation . Exposure of HUVECs to B. fragilis outer membrane fractions , separated from other components of the B. fragilis cell wall by isopycnic , sucrose gradient centrifugation , significantly increased surface expression of E-selectin and induced functional endothelial cell -dependent leukocyte adhesion . B. fragilis outer membranes induced translocation of NF-kappa B to HUVEC nuclei and accumulation of E-selectin mRNA in HUVEC cytoplasm . E-selectin expression induced by B. fragilis outer membranes was not blocked by polymixin B . In contrast , E-selectin expression induced by outer membrane fractions purified from E. coli was competitively inhibited by polymixin B . Neither purified B. fragilis LPS , a prominent constituent of the outer membrane , nor purified B. fragilis capsular polysaccharides induced HUVEC activation . Two different monoclonal antibodies directed against human CD14 completely inhibited B. fragilis outer membrane-induced NF-kappa B activation , E-selectin transcription , and E-selectin surface expression . We conclude that the outer membrane component of the B. fragilis cell wall contains a proinflammatory factor ( s ) , that is not LPS , which induces human endothelial cell activation by a soluble CD14 -dependent mechanism .",gene
"NF-kappaB protects HIV-1-infected myeloid cells from apoptosis . HIV-1 infection of primary monocytic cells and myeloid cell lines results in sustained NF-kappaB activation . Recently , NF-kappaB induction has been shown to play a role in protecting cells from programmed cell death . In the present study , we sought to investigate whether constitutive NF-kappaB activity in chronically HIV-1-infected promonocytic U937 ( U9-IIIB ) and myeloblastic PLB-985 ( PLB-IIIB ) cells affects apoptotic signaling . TNFalpha and cycloheximide caused infected cells to undergo apoptosis more rapidly than parental U937 and PLB-985 cells . Inhibition of TNFalpha -induced NF-kappaB activation using the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) resulted in increased apoptosis in both U937 and U9-IIIB cells , while preactivation of NF-kappaB with the non-apoptotic inducer IL-1beta caused a relative decrease in apoptosis . Inhibition of constitutive NF-kappaB activity in U9-IIIB and PLB-IIIB cells also induced apoptosis , suggesting that NF-kappaB protects cells from a persistent apoptotic signal . TNFalpha plus NAC treatment resulted in a marked decrease in Bcl-2 protein levels in HIV-1-infected cells , coupled with an increase in Bax protein compared to uninfected cells , suggesting that the difference in susceptibility to TNFalpha -induced apoptosis may relate to the differences in relative levels of Bcl-2 and Bax . The protective role of NF-kappaB in blocking TNFalpha- and HIV-1-induced apoptosis was supported by studies in Jurkat T cells engineered to express IkappaB alpha repressor mutants ( TD-IkappaB ) under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter . Cells underwent apoptosis in response to TNFalpha only when NF-kappaB activation was inhibited by TD-IkappaB expression .",gene
"As was observed for the U9-IIIB cells , TNFalpha treatment also induced a marked decrease in Bcl-2 protein levels in TD-IkappaB expressing cells . These experiments demonstrate that apoptotic signaling is perturbed in HIV-1-infected U9-IIIB cells and indicate that NF-kappaB activation may play an additional protective role against HIV-1-induced apoptosis in myeloid cells .",gene
"Human normal peripheral blood B-lymphocytes are deficient in DNA-dependent protein kinase activity due to the expression of a variant form of the Ku86 protein . The heterodimeric Ku protein , which comprises a 86 kDa ( Ku86 ) amd a 70 kDa ( Ku70 ) subunits , is an abundant nuclear DNA-binding protein which binds in vitro to DNA termini without sequence specificity . Ku is the DNA-targeting component of the large catalytic sub-unit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex ( DNA-PK [ CS ] ) , that plays a critical role in mammalian double-strand break repair and lymphoid V ( D ) J recombination . By using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we demonstrated that in addition to the major Ku x DNA complex usually detected in cell line extracts , a second complex with faster electrophoretic mobility was observed in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) extracts . The presence of this faster migrating complex was restricted to B cells among the circulating lymphocyte population . Western blot analysis revealed that B cells express a variant form of the Ku86 protein with an apparent molecular weight of 69 kDa , and not the 86 kDa- full-length protein . Although the heterodimer Ku70/variant-Ku86 binds to DNA-ends , this altered form of the Ku heterodimer has a decreased ability to recruit the catalytic component of the complex , DNA-PK ( CS ) , which contributes to an absence of detectable DNA-PK activity in B cells . These data provide a molecular basis for the increased sensitivity of B cells to ionizing radiation and identify a new mechanism of regulation of DNA-PK activity that operates in vivo .",gene
"Co-stimulation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with IL-2 and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies induces phosphorylation of CREB . Phosphorylation of the cAMP-response element binding protein CREB within 1 h of CD2 but not CD3 cross-linking of human PBMC was recently demonstrated . The absence of P-CREB following CD3 cross-linking was unexpected , as other laboratories reported increased phosphorylation of CREB following CD3 cross-linking of the Jurkat lymphocyte cell line . Due to Jurkat T-cells being IL-2-independent , it was postulated that IL-2 might provide a necessary co-stimulus for phosphorylation of CREB in primary lymphocytes . Therefore , P-CREB was evaluated following co-stimulation of human PBMC through the IL-2 and CD2 or CD3 receptors . IL-2 did not further augment phosphorylation of CREB following CD2 cross-linking . However , while neither IL-2 nor CD3 cross-linking alone induced P-CREB , a 4.5-fold increase in phosphorylation of CREB within 1 h of IL-2/CD3 co-stimulation was observed . Phosphorylation was not associated with the induction of cAMP , and inhibition of PKA signaling had no effect on P-CREB . Consistent with signal transduction through p56lck or p59fyn , inhibition of PTK signaling reduced phosphorylation 50 % . Interestingly , inhibiting PKC signaling with calphostin C further increased P-CREB levels 3-fold over that observed in IL-2/CD3 co-stimulated cells not pretreated with a PKC inhibitor . In contrast to previous studies performed in the absence of exogenous IL-2 , no increase in binding of CREB to a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe was observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . These data suggest that the IL-2 and CD3 signaling pathways provide a necessary and co-operative stimulus promoting phosphorylation of CREB following receptor cross-linking .",gene
"HIV-1 infection induces a selective reduction in STAT5 protein expression . HIV-1 infection is accompanied by qualitative and quantitative defects in CD4+ T lymphocytes . Loss of immune function in HIV patients is usually associated with a profound dysregulation of cytokine production . To investigate whether cytokine signaling defects occur during HIV infection , PHA blasts from healthy human donors were infected with two strains of HIV-1 and screened for the expression of STAT proteins used in cytokine signaling . A selective decrease in STAT5B was seen 8 days after infection with the BZ167 dual-tropic HIV isolate , but not with the Ba-L , M-tropic strain . Based on these findings , purified T cells from HIV-infected patients in different stages of disease were also tested for STAT expression ; decreases in STAT5A , STAT5B , and STAT1alpha were observed in all patients . The reduction in STATs seen in vivo and in vitro after HIV infection may contribute to the loss of T cell function in HIV disease .",gene
"Transcription factors that regulate monocyte / macrophage differentiation . Although all the cells in an organism contain the same genetic information , differences in the cell phenotype arise from the expression of lineage-specific genes . During myelopoiesis , external differentiating signals regulate the expression of a set of transcription factors . The combined action of these transcription factors subsequently determines the expression of myeloid-specific genes and the generation of monocytes and macrophages . In particular , the transcription factor PU.1 has a critical role in this process . We review the contribution of several transcription factors to the control of macrophage development",gene
"Transcription factor LKLF is sufficient to program T cell quiescence via a c-Myc -- dependent pathway . T lymphocytes circulate in a quiescent state until they encounter cognate antigen bound to the surface of an antigen-presenting cell . The molecular pathways that regulate T cell quiescence remain largely unknown . Here we show that forced expression of the lung Kruppel-like transcription factor ( LKLF ) in Jurkat T cells is sufficient to program a quiescent phenotype characterized by decreased proliferation , reduced cell size and protein synthesis and decreased surface expression of activation markers . Conversely , LKLF-deficient peripheral T cells produced by gene targeting showed increased proliferation , increased cell size and enhanced expression of surface activation markers in vivo . LKLF appeared to function , at least in part , by decreasing expression of the proto-oncogene encoding c-Myc . Forced expression of LKLF was associated with markedly decreased c-Myc expression . In addition , many effects of LKLF expression were mimicked by expression of the dominant-negative MadMyc protein and rescued by overexpression of c-Myc . Thus , LKLF is both necessary and sufficient to program quiescence in T cells and functions , in part , by negatively regulating a c-Myc -- dependent pathway .",gene
"HTLV-1 p12 ( I ) protein enhances STAT5 activation and decreases the interleukin-2 requirement for proliferation of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells . The p12 ( I ) protein , encoded by the pX open reading frame I of the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) , is a hydrophobic protein that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi . Although p12 ( I ) contains 4 minimal proline-rich , src homology 3-binding motifs ( PXXP ) , a characteristic commonly found in proteins involved in signaling pathways , it has not been known whether p12 ( I ) has a role in modulating intracellular signaling pathways . This study demonstrated that p12 ( I ) binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) beta chain that is involved in the recruitment of the Jak1 and Jak3 kinases . As a result of this interaction , p12 ( I ) increases signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 ( STAT5 ) DNA binding and transcriptional activity and this effect depends on the presence of both IL-2R beta and gamma ( c ) chains and Jak3 . Transduction of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) with a human immunodeficiency virus type 1-based retroviral vector expressing p12 ( I ) also resulted in increased STAT5 phosphorylation and DNA binding . However , p12 ( I ) could increase proliferation of human PBMCs only after stimulation of T-cell receptors by treatment of cells with low concentrations of alphaCD3 and alphaCD28 antibodies . In addition , the proliferative advantage of p12 ( I ) -transduced PBMCs was evident mainly at low concentrations of IL-2 . Together , these data indicate that p12 ( I ) may confer a proliferative advantage on HTLV-1-infected cells in the presence of suboptimal antigen stimulation and that this event may account for the clonal proliferation of infected T cells in vivo .

"Single dose intranasal administration of retinal autoantigen generates a rapid accumulation and cell activation in draining lymph node and spleen : implications for tolerance therapy . BACKGROUND/AIMS : A single intranasal delivery of retinal autoantigen suppresses effectively experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis ( EAU ) . To further unravel underlying mechanisms the authors wished to determine , firstly , the kinetics of antigen delivery and , secondly , the early cellular responses involved in the initial stages of nasal mucosal tolerance induction . METHODS : Flow cytometry , cell proliferation assays , and microscopy were used to track antigen following a single , intranasal dose of Alexa-488 labelled retinal antigen . RESULTS : A rapid accumulation of antigen within both superficial cervical lymph nodes ( SCLN ) and spleen was observed after 30 minutes . Significant proliferative responses to IRBP were elicited by 48 hours indicating that systemic priming of naive T cells to retinal antigen had occurred . Cell activation was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation studies , which demonstrated phosphorylation of STAT4 but not STAT6 in both lymph nodes and spleen . However , at 24 hours , STAT4 heterodimerisation with STAT 3 was only observed in spleen . CONCLUSIONS : The results provide novel evidence that following a single intranasal application rapid transfer of antigen occurs . Resulting T cell proliferation develops consequent to differential cell signalling in SCLN and spleen . Further understanding of these underlying cellular mechanisms , in particular as is inferred by the results the contribution of local versus systemic tolerance induction , may assist in strategies to clinically apply mucosal tolerance therapy successfully .",gene
"Regulation of interleukin ( IL ) -18 receptor alpha chain expression on CD4 ( + ) T cells during T helper ( Th ) 1/Th2 differentiation . Critical downregulatory role of IL-4 . Interleukin ( IL ) -18 has been well characterized as a costimulatory factor for the induction of IL-12-mediated interferon ( IFN ) -gamma production by T helper ( Th ) 1 cells , but also can induce IL-4 production and thus facilitate the differentiation of Th2 cells . To determine the mechanisms by which IL-18 might regulate these diametrically distinct immune responses , we have analyzed the role of cytokines in the regulation of IL-18 receptor alpha chain ( IL-18Ralpha ) expression . The majority of peripheral CD4 ( + ) T cells constitutively expressed the IL-18Ralpha . Upon antigen stimulation in the presence of IL-12 , marked enhancement of IL-18Ralpha expression was observed . IL-12 -mediated upregulation of IL-18Ralpha required IFN-gamma . Activated CD4 ( + ) T cells that expressed low levels of IL-18Ralpha could produce IFN-gamma when stimulated with the combination of IL-12 and IL-18 , while CD4 ( + ) cells which expressed high levels of IL-18Ralpha could respond to IL-18 alone . In contrast , T cell stimulation in the presence of IL-4 resulted in a downregulation of IL-18Ralpha expression . Both IL-4 ( -/ ) - and signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) 6 ( -/ ) - T cells expressed higher levels of IL-18Ralpha after TCR stimulation . Furthermore , activated T cells from Stat6 ( -/ ) - mice produced more IFN-gamma in response to IL-18 than wild-type controls . Thus , positive/negative regulation of the IL-18Ralpha by the major inductive cytokines ( IL-12 and IL-4 ) determines the capacity of IL-18 to polarize an immune response .",gene
"Glucocorticoid-regulated transcription factors . Glucocorticoids are the most effective antiinflammatory drugs used in the treatment of asthma . They act by binding to a specific receptor ( GR ) that , upon activation , translocates to the nucleus and either increases ( transactivates ) or decreases ( transrepresses ) gene expression . Inhibition of pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as activator protein ( AP ) -1 , signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STATs ) , nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) and nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B is thought to be a major action of glucocorticoids . Acetylation of histones allows unwinding of the local DNA structure and enables RNA polymerase II to enhance gene transcription . Histone acetylation is regulated by a balance between the activity of histone acetyltransferases ( HATs ) and histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) . GR acts as a direct inhibitor of NF-kappa B-induced HAT activity and also by recruiting HDAC2 to the NF-kappa B/HAT complex . A sub-group of patients with glucocorticoid-insensitive asthma have an inability to induce histone acetylation in response to dexamethasone suggesting reduced expression of a GR-specific HAT . This suggests that pharmacological manipulation of specific histone acetylation status is a potentially useful approach for the treatment of inflammatory diseases . Identification of the precise mechanism by which activated GR recruits HDAC2 may reveal new targets for the development of drugs that may dissociate the antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids from their side effects that are largely due to gene induction .

"Differential ultraviolet-B-induced immunomodulation in XPA , XPC , and CSB DNA repair-deficient mice . Ultraviolet B irradiation has serious consequences for cellular immunity and can suppress the rejection of skin tumors and the resistance to infectious diseases . DNA damage plays a crucial role in these immunomodulatory effects of ultraviolet B , as impaired repair of ultraviolet-B-induced DNA damage has been shown to cause suppression of cellular immunity . Ultraviolet-B-induced DNA damage is repaired by the nucleotide excision repair mechanism very efficiently . Nucleotide excision repair comprises two subpathways : transcription-coupled and global genome repair . In this study the immunologic consequences of specific nucleotide excision repair defects in three mouse models , XPA , XPC , and CSB mutant mice , were investigated . XPA mice carry a total nucleotide excision repair defect , whereas XPC and CSB mice only lack global genome and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair , respectively . Our data demonstrate that cellular immune parameters in XPA , XPC , and CSB mice are normal compared with their wild-type ( control ) littermates . This may indicate that the reported altered cellular responses in xeroderma pigmentosum patients are not constitutive but could be due to external factors , such as ultraviolet B . Upon exposure to ultraviolet B , only XPA mice are very sensitive to ultraviolet-B-induced inhibition of Th1-mediated contact hypersensitivity responses and interferon-gamma production in skin draining lymph nodes . Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-10 production are significantly augmented in both XPA and CSB mice after ultraviolet B exposure . Lymph node cell numbers were increased very significantly in XPA , mildly increased in CSB , and not in XPC mice . In general XPC mice do not exhibit any indication of enhanced ultraviolet B susceptibility with regard to the immune parameters analyzed . These data suggest that both global genome repair and transcription-coupled repair are needed to prevent immunomodulation by ultraviolet B , whereas transcription-coupled repair is the major DNA repair subpathway of nucleotide excision repair that prevents the acute",gene

"Biomechanical strain induces class a scavenger receptor expression in human monocyte/macrophages and THP-1 cells : a potential mechanism of increased atherosclerosis in hypertension . BACKGROUND : Although hypertension is an important risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis , the mechanisms for this interaction are incompletely described . Previous studies have suggested that biomechanical strain regulates macrophage phenotype . We tested the hypothesis that biomechanical strain can induce expression of the class A scavenger receptor ( SRA ) , an important lipoprotein receptor in atherogenesis . METHODS AND RESULTS : Human monocyte/macrophages or THP-1 cells were cultured in a device that imposes uniform biaxial cyclic 1-Hz strains of 0 % , 1 % , 2 % , or 3 % , and SRA expression was analyzed . Mechanical strains induced SRA mRNA ( 3.5+/-0.6-fold at 3 % strain for 48 hours , P < 0.01 ) and SRA protein in THP-1 cells in an amplitude-dependent manner . This induction was accompanied by augmented expression of the class B scavenger receptor CD36 ( 2.8+/-0.3-fold , P < 0.001 ) but not by increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma expression . To evaluate this effect in vivo , apolipoprotein E ( -/- ) mice were randomly assigned to receive standard chow , a high-cholesterol diet , or a high-cholesterol diet with hypertension induced by angiotensin II infusion for 8 weeks . Immunohistochemistry revealed that among macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions of the aorta , the proportion of macrophages with SRA expression was highest in hypertensive animals on a high-cholesterol diet ( 43.9+/-0.7 % , versus 12.0+/-2.0 % for normotensive animals on a high-cholesterol diet and 4.7+/-4.7 % for animals on standard chow ; P < 0.001 ) .

"High glucose induces MCP-1 expression partly via tyrosine kinase-AP-1 pathway in peritoneal mesothelial cells . BACKGROUND : High glucose in peritoneal dialysis solutions has been implicated in the pathogenesis of peritoneal fibrosis in chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) patients . However , the mechanisms are not very clear . Peritoneal macrophages seem to participate in the process of peritoneal fibrosis and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) plays a key role in the recruitment of monocytes toward the peritoneal cavity . However , little is known about the effect of high glucose on MCP-1 expression and its signal transduction pathway in human peritoneal mesothelial cells . METHODS : Mesothelial cells were cultured with glucose ( 5 to 100 mmol/L ) or mannitol chronically for up to seven days . MCP-1 expression of mRNA and protein was measured by Northern blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Chemotactic activity of high-glucose-conditioned culture supernatant was measured by chemotactic assay . To examine the roles of the transcription factors activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) and nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) was performed . RESULTS : Glucose induced MCP-1 mRNA expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner . MCP-1 protein in cell culture supernant was also increased . Equivalent concentrations of mannitol had no significant effect . High-glucose-conditioned supernatant possessed an increased chemotactic activity for monocytes , which was neutralized by anti-MCP-1 antibody . EMSA revealed that glucose increased the AP-1 binding activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner , but not NF-kappaB .

"Signal thresholds and modular synergy during expression of costimulatory molecules in B lymphocytes . We analyzed intracellular pathways modulating surface densities of CD80 and CD86 in B cells activated through ligation of the Ag receptor , and the adhesion molecule CD54 . Whereas B cell Ag receptor ( BCR ) cross-linking alone stimulated increased expression of CD86 , up-regulation of CD80 required dual stimulation with anti-IgM and anti-CD54 . The principal downstream component contributed by BCR signaling , toward both CD80 and CD86 induction , was the elevated concentration of free cytoplasmic Ca ( 2+ ) , recruited by way of capacitative influx . This alone was sufficient to generate an increase in CD86 levels . However , CD80 enhancement required the concerted action of both intracellular Ca ( 2+ ) concentration and CD54-initiated pathways . The nexus between anti-IgM and anti-CD54 stimulation , in the context of CD80 regulation , was identified to involve a self-propagating process of sequential synergy . The first step involved amplified accumulation of intracellular cAMP , as a result of cross-talk between BCR -mobilized Ca ( 2+ ) and CD54-derived signals . This then facilitated a second synergistic interaction between Ca ( 2+ ) and cAMP , culminating in CD80 expression . Our findings of distinct signal transducer requirements , with the added consequences of cross-talk , offers an explanation for variable modulation of costimulatory molecule expression in response to diverse physiological stimuli . Importantly , these results also reveal how concentration threshold barriers for recruitment of individual second messengers can be overcome by constructive convergence of signaling modules .",gene
"The role of Epstein-Barr virus in neoplastic transformation . In this review , we focus on new data from basic , translational and clinical research relating to the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) . Beside its well-known tropism for B lymphocytes and epithelial cells , EBV also infects T lymphocytes , monocytes and granulocytes . After primary infection , EBV persists throughout the life span in resting memory B cells , from where it is reactivated upon breakdown of cellular immunity . In the process of neoplastic transformation , the EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) oncogene represents the major driving force . LMP1 acts like a constitutively activated receptor of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and allows the amplification or bypassing of physiological regulatory signals through direct and indirect interactions with proteins of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor ( TRAF ) family . TRAF2 -mediated NF-kappaB activation , AP-1 induction and JAK3 / STAT activation may result in sustained proliferation leading to lymphoma . The ability of LMP1 to suppress germinal center formation and its capacity to mediate its own transcriptional activation shed new light on the pathogenesis of EBV-associated latency type II lymphoproliferations like Hodgkin 's disease and angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy . The carboxy terminus of LMP1 is also a reliable marker for individual EBV strain identification and thus offers new possibilities in tracing the molecular events leading to posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders ( PTLDs ) . Cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against well-characterized epitopes of EBV latency genes represent an already successful and promising therapeutic approach to EBV-associated lymphomas , in particular PTLDs",gene
"Interferon-alpha drives T cell-mediated immunopathology in the intestine . The ability of interferon ( IFN ) -alpha to induce autoimmunity and exacerbate Th1 diseases is well known . We have recently described enhanced expression of IFN-alpha in the mucosa of patients with celiac disease ( CD ) , a gluten-sensitive Th1-mediated enteropathy , characterized by villous atrophy and crypt cell hyperplasia . Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that T cell activation in explant cultures of human fetal gut can also result in villous atrophy and crypt cell hyperplasia . We have , therefore , examined changes that take place in explant cultures of human fetal gut after activation of T cells with anti-CD3 and/or IFN-alpha . We show that activation of T cells with anti-CD3 alone elicits a small IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha response with no tissue injury . Similarly , no changes are seen in explants cultured with IFN-alpha alone . However , addition of IFN-alpha with anti-CD3 results in enhanced Th1 response and crypt cell hyperplasia . This is associated with enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1 , STAT3 , and Fyn , a Src homology tyrosine kinase , which interacts with both TCR and IFN-alpha signal components . Together these data indicate that IFN-alpha can facilitate activation of Th1-reactive cells in the gut and drive immunopathology .",gene
"Suppression of tumor necrosis factor alpha production by cAMP in human monocytes : dissociation with mRNA level and independent of interleukin-10 . BACKGROUND : Elevation of cellular cAMP inhibits lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) production and increases the expression of interleukin ( IL ) -10 in mononuclear cells . TNF-alpha gene expression obligates activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) . Exogenous IL-10 inhibits NF-kappaB in monocytes and thus attenuates TNF-alpha production . We examined the role of endogenous IL-10 in the regulation of NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha production in human monocytes by cAMP . METHODS : Human monocytes were stimulated with Escherichia coli LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) with and without forskolin ( FSK , 50 microM ) or dibutyryl cyclic AMP ( dbcAMP , 100 microM ) . Cytokine ( TNF-alpha and IL-10 ) release was measured by immunoassay . TNF-alpha mRNA was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction , and NF-kappaB DNA binding activity was assessed by gel mobility shift assay . RESULTS : cAMP-elevating agents inhibited LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha release ( 0.77 +/- 0.13 ng/10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS + dbcAMP and 0.68 +/- 0.19 ng/10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS + FSK , both P < 0.05 vs 1.61 +/- 0.34 ng/10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS alone ) . Conversely , cAMP enhanced LPS-stimulated IL-10 release ( 100 +/- 21.5 pg/10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS + dbcAMP and 110 +/- 25.2 pg/10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS + FSK , both P < 0.05 vs 53.3 +/- 12.8",gene

"Activation of the p21 ( CIP1/WAF1 ) promoter by bone morphogenetic protein-2 in mouse B lineage cells . BMPs exert a negative growth effect on various types of cells . We have previously reported that BMP-2 inhibited the growth of HS-72 mouse hybridoma cells by inducing p21 ( CIP1/WAF1 ) expression . In the present study , we demonstrated that BMP-2 activated the mouse p21 ( CIP1/WAF1 ) promoter in HS-72 cells , and that a 29-base pair ( b ) region of the promoter ( -1928/-1900 relative to the TATA box ) , conserved between mice and humans , was responsive to BMP-2 as well as expression of Smad1 , Smad4 , and constitutively active mutants of BMP type I receptors . Furthermore , an oligonucleotide containing the 29-b region was found to be associated with Smad4 and phosphorylated Smad1 in the nuclear extract of BMP-2 -stimulated HS-72 cells . These results suggested that BMP-2 might activate p21 ( CIP1/WAF1 ) transcription by inducing a binding of Smad4 and Smad1 to the 29-b region in HS-72 cells .",gene
"Dendritic cell development from common myeloid progenitors . Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are professional antigen-presenting cells which both initiate adaptive immune responses and control tolerance to self-antigens . It has been suggested that these different effects on responder cells depend on subsets of DCs arising from either myeloid or lymphoid hematopoietic origins . In this model , CD8 alpha+ Mac-1- DCs are supposed to be of lymphoid while CD8 alpha- Mac-1+ DCs are supposed to be of myeloid origin . Here we summarize our findings that both CD8 alpha+ and CD8 alpha- DCs can arise from clonogenic common myeloid progenitors ( CMPs ) in both thymus and spleen . Therefore CD8 alpha expression DCs does not indicate a lymphoid origin and differences among CD8 alpha+ and CD8 alpha- DCs might rather reflect maturation status than ontogeny . On the basis of transplantation studies , it seems likely that most of the DCs in secondary lymphoid organs and a substantial fraction of thymic DCs are myeloid-derived .",gene
"Macrophage stimulation with Murabutide , an HIV-suppressive muramyl peptide derivative , selectively activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 , C/EBPbeta and STAT1 : role of CD14 and Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 . The smallest unit of bacterial peptidoglycans known to be endowed with biological activities is muramyl dipeptide ( MDP ) . A clinically acceptable synthetic derivative of MDP , namely murabutide ( MB ) , has been found to present interesting pharmacological properties and to suppress HIV-1 replication in monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ) . We have addressed the signaling events activated in MDM following stimulation with either MB or the potent immunostimulant LPS . We also examined whether signaling by muramyl peptides involves the use of cell surface receptors , including CD14 and Toll-like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) or TLR4 that are known to be signal-transducing receptors for other bacterial cell wall components . We demonstrate that , unlike LPS , the safe immunomodulator MB selectively activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( Erk ) 1/2 , in the absence of detectable Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) or p38 mitogen-activated kinase activation . Furthermore , STAT1 activation but weak or no activation of STAT3 or STAT5 respectively , could be detected in MB-stimulated MDM . Using MonoMac6 cells , we observed high C/EBPbeta and AP-1 but weaker and transient NF-kappaB activation by MB . Moreover , the truncated form of C/EBPbeta , known to repress HIV-1 transcription , was detected in extracts from MB-treated THP-1 cells . Surprisingly , neither MB nor MDP were able to transduce signals via CD14 and TLR2 or 4 . These findings present major differences in the early cell activation process between LPS and muramyl peptides , and strongly argue for the implication of co-receptors other than TLR2 and TLR4 in mediating the signaling events induced by defined subunits of bacterial peptidoglycans .",gene
"Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and gamma have opposing effects on monocyte chemotaxis in endometriosis . The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( PPARs ) alpha and gamma are nuclear receptors that play important roles in inflammatory diseases like ulcerative colitis and arthritis . In this study , we examined the possible role of PPARs in macrophage attraction into the peritoneal cavity of patients with endometriosis . We identified PPAR-alpha and -gamma messenger RNA by RT-PCR and protein by immunoblotting of lysates of peritoneal macrophages and monocytic U937 cells . Using immunocytochemistry , we localized PPAR-alpha and -gamma within the nuclei of both cell types . Monocyte chemotactic activity of peritoneal fluid from patients with endometriosis was quantified in Boyden chambers . Migration of U937 cells was increased by WY 14643 and reduced by rosiglitazone . Peritoneal fluid from patients with endometriosis activated U937 cells transiently transfected with a PPAR-alpha/GAL4 luciferase reporter . By contrast , peritoneal fluid did not cause significant activation of PPAR-gamma/GAL4 constructs . The U937 cells transiently transfected with a PPAR response element luciferase reporter showed disease stage-dependent up-regulation when treated with peritoneal fluid from patients with endometriosis . Treatment with peritoneal fluid from healthy controls down-regulated PPAR response element transactivation . We conclude that peritoneal fluid of endometriosis patients contains activators of PPAR-alpha that stimulate macrophage chemotaxis . Inhibitors of PPAR-alpha or activators of PPAR-gamma could be developed for the treatment of inflammation associated with endometriosis .",gene
"Long-term-impaired expression of nuclear factor-kappa B and I kappa B alpha in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of trauma patients . Nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B expression and dimer characteristics were studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) of major-trauma patients and healthy controls . Analysis of PBMCs on days 1 , 3 , 5 , and 10 after trauma revealed that expression of both p65p50 heterodimers and p50p50 homodimers was significantly reduced compared with that in controls . In vitro lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation of PBMCs induced NF-kappa B translocation . However , throughout the survey , p65p50 activation remained significantly lower in trauma patients than in controls . After LPS stimulation in vitro , the p65p50/p50p50 ratio was significantly lower in PBMCs from trauma patients than from healthy controls . The ex vivo expression of I kappa B alpha was higher in PBMCs of controls than of trauma patients . LPS did not induce I kappa B expression in PBMCs from trauma patients , but strong induction was obtained with staphylococci , suggesting that this defect is not universal and depends on the nature of the activating signal . Although no direct correlation was found between levels of interleukin-10 or transforming growth factor-beta and NF-kappa B , these immunosuppressive cytokines were significantly elevated in trauma patients by 10 days after admission . The long-term low-basal and LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B recalled long-term immunoparalysis observed in patients with severe inflammatory stress such as trauma .",gene
"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury . BACKGROUND : The morbidity associated with liver transplantation and major hepatic resections is partly a result of ischemia-reperfusion injury . DATA SOURCES : The entire world literature on the subject was searched via Medline . Keywords included reperfusion injury , transplantation , liver resection , nitric oxide , endothelin , cytokines , Kupffer cells , ischemic/ischaemic preconditioning , and nuclear factor-kappa B . CONCLUSIONS : An imbalance between endothelin and nitric oxide levels results in failure of the hepatic microcirculation at the onset of reperfusion . Activation of nuclear factor-kappa B in the liver promotes proinflammatory cytokine and adhesion molecule synthesis . These result in oxygen-derived free radical production and neutrophil recruitment , further contributing to cellular injury . Various therapeutic modalities acting on the above mediators have been successfully used to attenuate reperfusion injury in animal models of hepatic transplantation and resection . Application of the knowledge gained from animal models of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion to the clinical setting will improve the outcome of hepatic surgery .",gene
"Down-regulation of IL-12 p40 gene in Plasmodium berghei-infected mice . We analyzed the mechanism that causes suppression of IL-12 p40 gene induction during Plasmodium berghei infection . Although IL-12 together with IFN-gamma plays an important role in protection against pathogenic infection , the IL-12 p70 protein production of infected macrophages is lower than that by the uninfected macrophages . We showed in the present study that the induction of IL-12 p40 gene but not IL-12 p35 gene in macrophages of P. berghei-infected mice was profoundly inhibited . The inhibition was induced by interaction with macrophages that had contacted with P. berghei-infected erythrocytes and was mediated by a soluble factor , IL-10 . There was comparable activation of NF-kappaB in uninfected and infected cells . The induction of IFN-regulatory factor-1 gene was comparable in transcription level in uninfected and infected cells , while the unidentified complex formation of IFN-regulatory factor-1 was observed in infected cells . Therefore , the inhibition of the IL-12 p40 gene induction appeared to be regulated at transcriptional regulation level of the gene .",gene
"The Friend of GATA proteins U-shaped , FOG-1 , and FOG-2 function as negative regulators of blood , heart , and eye development in Drosophila . Friend of GATA ( FOG ) proteins regulate GATA factor-activated gene transcription . During vertebrate hematopoiesis , FOG and GATA proteins cooperate to promote erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation . The Drosophila FOG homologue U-shaped ( Ush ) is expressed similarly in the blood cell anlage during embryogenesis . During hematopoiesis , the acute myeloid leukemia 1 homologue Lozenge and Glial cells missing are required for the production of crystal cells and plasmatocytes , respectively . However , additional factors have been predicted to control crystal cell proliferation . In this report , we show that Ush is expressed in hemocyte precursors and plasmatocytes throughout embryogenesis and larval development , and the GATA factor Serpent is essential for Ush embryonic expression . Furthermore , loss of ush function results in an overproduction of crystal cells , whereas forced expression of Ush reduces this cell population . Murine FOG-1 and FOG-2 also can repress crystal cell production , but a mutant version of FOG-2 lacking a conserved motif that binds the corepressor C-terminal binding protein fails to affect the cell lineage . The GATA factor Pannier ( Pnr ) is required for eye and heart development in Drosophila . When Ush , FOG-1 , FOG-2 , or mutant FOG-2 is coexpressed with Pnr during these developmental processes , severe eye and heart phenotypes result , consistent with a conserved negative regulation of Pnr function . These results indicate that the fly and mouse FOG proteins function similarly in three distinct cellular contexts in Drosophila , but may use different mechanisms to regulate genetic events in blood vs . cardial or eye cell lineages",gene
"The RING finger protein Siah-1 regulates the level of the transcriptional coactivator OBF-1 . The transcriptional coactivator OBF-1 , which interacts with Oct-1 and Oct-2 and the octamer site DNA , has been shown to be critical for development of a normal immune response and the formation of germinal centers in secondary lymphoid organs . Here we have identified the RING finger protein Siah-1 as a protein interacting specifically with OBF-1 . This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal part of Siah-1 and by residues in the N-terminus of OBF-1 , partly distinct from the residues required for formation of a complex with the Oct POU domains and the DNA . Interaction between Siah-1 and OBF-1 leads to downregulation of OBF-1 protein level but not mRNA , and to a corresponding reduction in octamer site-dependent transcription activation . Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in B cells leads to elevated levels of OBF-1 protein . Furthermore , in immunized mice , OBF-1 protein amounts are dramatically increased in primary activated B cells , without concomitant increase in OBF-1 mRNA . These data suggest that Siah-1 is part of a novel regulatory loop controlling the level of OBF-1 protein in B cells .",gene
"The beta-catenin -- TCF-1 pathway ensures CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) thymocyte survival . The association of trans-acting T cell factors ( TCFs ) or lymphoid enhancer factor 1 ( LEF-1 ) with their coactivator beta-catenin mediates transient transcriptional responses to extracellular Wnt signals . We show here that T cell maturation depends on the presence of the beta-catenin -- binding domain in TCF-1 . This domain is necessary to mediate the survival of immature CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) double-positive ( DP ) thymocytes . Accelerated spontaneous thymocyte death in the absence of TCF-1 correlates with aberrantly low expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x ( L ) . Increasing anti-apoptotic effectors in thymocytes by the use of a Bcl-2 transgene rescued TCF-1-deficient DP thymocytes from apoptosis . Thus , TCF-1 , upon association with beta-catenin , transiently ensures the survival of immature T cells , which enables them to generate and edit T cell receptor ( TCR ) alpha chains and attempt TCR -mediated positive selection .",gene
"TRAIL/Apo2L ligand selectively induces apoptosis and overcomes drug resistance in multiple myeloma : therapeutic applications . Multiple myeloma ( MM ) remains incurable and novel treatments are urgently needed . Preclinical in vitro and in vivo evaluations were performed to assess the potential therapeutic applications of human recombinant tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -related apoptosis-inducing ligand/Apo2 ligand ( TRAIL/Apo2L ) in MM . TRAIL/Apo2L potently induced apoptosis of MM cells from patients and the majority of MM cell lines , including cells sensitive or resistant to dexamethasone ( Dex ) , doxorubicin ( Dox ) , melphalan , and mitoxantrone . TRAIL/Apo2L also overcame the survival effect of interleukin 6 on MM cells and did not affect the survival of peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells and purified B cells from healthy donors . The status of the TRAIL receptors ( assessed by immunoblotting and flow cytometry ) could not predict TRAIL sensitivity of MM cells . The anti-MM activity of TRAIL/Apo2L was confirmed in nu/xid/bg mice xenografted with human MM cells ; TRAIL ( 500 microg intraperitoneally daily for 14 days ) was well tolerated and significantly suppressed the growth of plasmacytomas . Dox up-regulated the expression of the TRAIL receptor death receptor 5 ( DR5 ) and synergistically enhanced the effect of TRAIL not only against MM cells sensitive to , but also against those resistant to , Dex- or Dox-induced apoptosis . Nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB inhibitors , such as SN50 ( a cell-permeable inhibitor of the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB ) or the proteasome inhibitor PS-341 , enhanced the proapoptotic activity of TRAIL/Apo2L against TRAIL-sensitive MM cells , whereas SN50 reversed the TRAIL resistance of ARH-77 and IM-9 MM cells .",gene
"Importantly , normal B lymphocytes were not sensitized to TRAIL by either Dox , SN50 , or PS-341 .

"CD28 costimulation is required not only to induce IL-12 receptor but also to render janus kinases/STAT4 responsive to IL-12 stimulation in TCR-triggered T cells . The activation of resting T cells for the acquisition of various functions depends on whether CD28 costimulatory signals are provided upon T cell receptor stimulation . Here , we investigated how CD28 costimulation functions to allow TCR -triggered resting T cells to acquire IL-12 responsiveness . When T cells are stimulated with low doses of anti-CD3 mAb , CD28 costimulation was required for the optimal levels of IL-12 receptor ( IL-12R ) expression . However , stimulation of T cells with high doses of anti-CD3 alone induced comparable levels of IL-12R expression to those induced upon CD28 costimulation . Nevertheless , there was a substantial difference in IL-12 responsiveness between these two groups of T cells : compared to anti-CD28-costimulated T cells , T cells that were not costimulated with anti-CD28 exhibited decreased levels of Janus kinases ( JAK ) JAK2/TYK2 and STAT4 phosphorylation and IFN-y production following IL-12 stimulation . Importantly , STAT6 phosphorylation following IL-4 stimulation was not decreased in anti-CD28-uncostimulated T cells . These resutls indicate that CD28 costimulation not only contributes to up-regulating IL-12R expression but is also required to render JAKs/STAT4 responsive to IL-12 stimulation .",gene
"Constitutively activated Akt-1 is vital for the survival of human monocyte-differentiated macrophages . Role of Mcl-1 , independent of nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB , Bad , or caspase activation . Recent data from mice deficient for phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 or src homology 2 domain-containing 5 ' inositol phosphatase , phosphatases that negatively regulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway , revealed an increased number of macrophages in these animals , suggesting an essential role for the PI3K pathway for macro-phage survival . Here , we focused on the role of the PI3K-regulated serine/threonine kinase Akt-1 in modulating macrophage survival . Akt-1 was constitutively activated in human macrophages and addition of the PI3K inhibitor , LY294002 , suppressed the activation of Akt-1 and induced cell death . Furthermore , suppression of Akt-1 by inhibition of PI3K or a dominant negative ( DN ) Akt-1 resulted in loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential , activation of caspases-9 and -3 , and DNA fragmentation . The effects of PI3K inhibition were reversed by the ectopic expression of constitutively activated Akt-1 or Bcl-x ( L ) . Inhibition of PI3K /Akt-1 pathway either by LY294002 or DN Akt-1 had no effect on the constitutive or inducible activation of nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB in human macrophages . However , after inhibition of the PI3K / Akt-1 pathway , a marked decrease in the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule Mcl-1 , but not other Bcl-2 family members was observed , and Mcl-1 rescued macrophages from LY294002-induced cell death . Further , inhibition of Mcl-1 by antisense oligonucleotides , also resulted in macrophage apoptosis . Thus , our findings demonstrate that the",gene

"GRbeta expression in nasal polyp inflammatory cells and its relationship to the anti-inflammatory effects of intranasal fluticasone . BACKGROUND : Nasal polyposis disease is an inflammatory disorder with intense eosinophilic infiltration of respiratory mucosa that is often difficult to control with topical steroids . Recent evidence suggests that overexpression of the glucocorticoid receptor splice variant GRbeta in inflammatory cells might contribute to steroid insensitivity in diseases such as asthma . OBJECTIVE : The purposes of this investigation were to determine whether nasal polyp ( NP ) inflammatory cells overexpress GRbeta and to examine whether GRbeta overexpression is associated with insensitivity to the potent topical steroid fluticasone propionate ( FP ) . METHODS : Biopsies were obtained from 10 subjects with NPs before and 4 weeks after treatment with intranasal FP . Middle turbinates biopsies from 6 healthy , nonallergic subjects served as normal controls . Biopsies were immunostained for inflammatory cell markers as well as GRbeta and probed for various cytokine mRNA . The anti-inflammatory response to FP was examined in relation to pretreatment levels of GRbeta expression . RESULTS : The total numbers of inflammatory cells were increased in NPs . The percentage of inflammatory cells expressing GRbeta was also increased ( 40.5 % +/- 19.2 % vs 16.1 % +/- 4.0 % , P =.009 ) . GRbeta expression in NPs was almost exclusive to T lymphocytes , eosinophils , and macrophages . An inverse correlation was observed between the baseline inflammatory cell GRbeta expression and the reduction after FP treatment in EG2-positive eosinophils , CD4-positive T lymphocytes , endothelial VCAM-1 expression , and IL-4 mRNA-positive cells . NPs that were `` FP-insensitive '' in terms of suppression of eosinophil numbers ( major basic protein -positive ) had a significantly greater percentage of GRbeta-positive inflammatory cells ,",gene

CONCLUSION : GRbeta expression appears to be a marker of steroid insensitivity in NPs . Expression of GRbeta by NP inflammatory cells , particularly T cells and eosinophils , might render them resistant to suppression by topical steroids and thereby contribute to persistent NP inflammation .",gene
"Transcriptional regulation of galectin-10 ( eosinophil Charcot-Leyden crystal protein ) : a GC box ( -44 to -50 ) controls butyric acid induction of gene expression . Galectin-10 ( gal-10 , also known as Charcot-Leyden crystal protein ) is a member of the galectin family of beta-galactoside binding proteins that is expressed uniquely in eosinophilic and basophilic leukocytes . To gain a better understanding of galectin gene expression , we present an analysis of the transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding gal-10 . Analysis of the minimal promoter revealed nine consensus-binding sites for transcription factors , including several that are also found in the minimal promoters of galectins -1 , -2 , and -3 . The decrease in gal-10 promoter activity after disruption of either the GC box ( -44 to -50 ) or the Oct site ( -255 to -261 ) suggests that these sites , along with the previously characterized GATA and EoTF sites , are necessary for full promoter activity . By supershift analysis , we demonstrate binding of the transcription factors Sp1 and Oct1 to the consensus GC box and the Oct site , respectively . Similar to gal-1 , gal-10 expression is induced by butyric acid , an effect that is lost upon ablation of the GC box . Additionally , we demonstrate AML3 binding to the consensus AML site and YY1 binding to the Inr sequence , both elements functioning as silencers in the gal-10 promoter .",gene
"Tumour-stromal interactions . Role of the stroma in mammary development . Mammary development depends on branching morphogenesis , namely the bifurcation and extension of ductal growth points ( end buds ) and secretory lobules into a more or less fatty stroma . Because breast carcinomas are overwhelmingly ductal in origin , this review focuses on stromal influences guiding postnatal ductal development and there is only the briefest account of the role of embryonic stroma ( mesenchyme ) . The stroma as the necessary target for endocrine mammogens and the source of stimulatory growth factors is described and the importance of mammary epithelium-induced modifications of the periductal stroma is emphasized . Evidence is presented that if they are to grow , end buds must condition proximal fatty stroma by recruiting white blood cells as well as inducing stromal cell division and , possibly , estrogen receptors . The induction of a fibrous stromal tunic around the end bud is described and its likely role as a complex ductal morphogen is discussed ; a possible role in growth inhibition is also considered . Although the signals governing fibrotic induction , ductal morphogenesis , and growth inhibition are unknown , a role for transforming growth factor-beta is highly likely and is discussed . Finally , a need for new conceptual and experimental approaches to understanding stromal-epithelial signaling is discussed .",gene
"Adipophilin is a sensitive marker for lipid loading in human blood monocytes . Adipophilin , a marker of lipid accumulation initially described in adipocytes , was recently shown to be induced in macrophage foam cells . We found that even freshly isolated blood monocytes express adipophilin and that the amount of adipophilin protein is variable in monocytes from different healthy individuals . However , the physiological expression of adipophilin does not correlate with the levels of free fatty acids , cholesterylesters or free cholesterol . Enzymatically modified low-density lipoprotein ( E-LDL ) induces rapid foam cell formation in monocytes and upregulates adipophilin mRNA and protein within 2 h of incubation . This rapid induction of adipophilin is accompanied by a significant increase of free fatty acids in monocytes incubated with E-LDL . Adipophilin facilitates the uptake of free fatty acids , and here we demonstrate that free fatty acids increase is related to the early upregulation of adipophilin expression in blood monocytes . Fatty acids are ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARgamma ) , and the upregulation of adipophilin mRNA by PPARgamma agonists like 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) and ciglitazone indicates that PPARgamma may mediate the induction of adipophilin expression in human blood monocytes .",gene
"Constitutive expression of MHC class II genes in melanoma cell lines results from the transcription of class II transactivator abnormally initiated from its B cell-specific promoter . In melanoma cell lines , two different patterns of MHC class II expression have been described , either an IFN gamma-inducible expression of HLA-DR and HLA-DP , with a faint or O expression of HLA-DQ , resembling that described for melanocytes , or a constitutive expression , i.e. , IFN-gamma independent , of all three HLA-D isotypes . As this latter phenotype has been associated with a more rapid progression of melanoma tumors , we have analyzed in different melanoma cell lines the molecular mechanisms leading to this abnormal pattern of MHC class II expression . In agreement with the evidence of a coordinate transcription of the HLA-D genes in these cell lines , we have shown the constitutive expression of CIITA ( class II transactivator ) transcripts , CIITA being known as the master switch of MHC class II expression . Unexpectedly , these transcripts initiate from promoter III of the CIITA gene , a promoter that is mainly used constitutively in B lymphocytes . This expression was further shown to occur through factor ( s ) acting on the enhancer located upstream of CIITA promoter III , which was previously described in epithelioid cells as an IFN-gamma-response sequence . The hypothesis of a general abnormality of the IFN-gamma transduction pathway was dismissed . Constitutive transcription of CIITA from promoter III having been observed in unrelated melanoma cell lines , we propose the hypothesis that this phenomenon might not be a random event , but could be linked to the neoplasic state of the melanoma cells",gene
"Caspase -mediated calcineurin activation contributes to IL-2 release during T cell activation . Calcineurin , a Ca ( 2+ ) /calmodulin-dependent Ser/Thr phosphatase ( protein phosphatase 2B ) , plays a critical role in IL-2 production during T cell activation . It has been previously reported that IL-2 release in activated Jurkat T requires caspase-like activity ( Posmantur et al. ( 1998 ) Exp. Cell. Res. 244 , 302-309 ) . We report here that the 60-kDa catalytic subunit of calcineurin A ( Cn A ) was partially cleaved to a 45-kDa form in phytohemagglutinin A ( PHA ) or phorbol ester + ionomycin ( P + I ) -activated Jurkat cells . In parallel , proteolytic activation of upstream caspases ( caspase-8 and -9 ) as well as effector caspase-3 was also observed . Cn A cleavage was caspase mediated , since it was inhibitable by pan-caspase inhibitor Cbz-Asp-CH ( 2 ) OC ( O ) -2 , 6-dichlorobenzene ( Z-D-DCB ) . Cn A cleavage was also observed when purified calcineurin was digested in vitro with caspase-3 . Truncated Cn A was associated with enhanced phosphatase activity and reduced calmodulin sensitivity . Furthermore , in PHA or P + I-activated Jurkat cells , dephosphorylation of calcineurin substrate NFATc ( a transcription factor known to be involved in transactivation of the IL-2 gene ) , was also suppressed by Z-D-DCB . Taken together , our results suggest that caspase-mediated cleavage of Cn A contributes to IL-2 production during T cell activation . Copyright 2001 Academic Press .",gene
"Maturation of human dendritic cells as sulfasalazine target . AIM : Sulfasalazine , a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug , is effective in treating some autoimmune diseases , but its mechanism of action is unclear . To determine whether dendritic cells could be a possible target of the drug , we studied the effects of sulfasalazine and its metabolites , aminosalicylate and sulfapyridine , on in vitro maturation ( terminal differentiation ) of human myeloid dendritic cells . METHODS : We prepared immature dendritic cells by incubating CD14-positive cells in the presence of granulocyte- macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin ( IL ) -4 . The cells were matured by addition of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -a , IL-1 beta , and prostaglandin E2 in the presence of sulfasalazine or its metabolites -- aminosalicylate and sulfapyridine , or their combinations . We quantified the effect of drugs on the dendritic cell characteristics , such as stimulation of autologous and allogeneic pan-T cell proliferation , surface marker phenotype , IL-12 p40 subunit secretion , and activation of nuclear transcription factor ( NF ) -kappa B . RESULTS : Dendritic cells treated with sulfasalazine ( 1.25 micromol/L or 2.5 micromol/L ) could not stimulate T cells ( p < 0.028 , two-sided paired t-test ) . In distinction to drug-free maturing dendritic cells , 2.5 micromol/L sulfasalazine upregulated the levels of CD14 and CD68 and downregulated the levels of CD40 , CD80 , and CD83 ( for all CD markers , p < 0.03 for difference between measurements in the absence and the presence of sulfasalazine ) . From concentration-dependent changes in CD83 expression , we found an apparent ID50 > > 1.5 micromol/L sulfasalazine . The apparent ID50 value for aminosalicylate-inhibited maturation was 4 micromol/L .",gene
"Sulfapyridine had no effect . At 1.25 micromol/L , sulfasalazine largely inhibited NF-kB activation in dendritic cells . CONCLUSION : Maturing human dendritic cells are hundred-fold more sensitive to sulfasalazine than T cells and NK cells and the most sensitive human cells described so far . Thus , dendritic cell maturation is an important target of sulfasalazine . Because of the role of dendritic cells in ( auto ) immunity , inhibition of their maturation might provide a target for further optimization of sulfasalazine therapy .",gene
"Defective function of the proteasome in autoimmunity : involvement of impaired NF-kappaB activation . Type 1 diabetes ( also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or juvenile-onset diabetes ) is usually caused by T cell-mediated autoimmunity , with a prediabetic state characterized by the production of autoantibodies specific for proteins expressed by pancreatic beta cells . The nonobese patient with diabetes ( NOD ) mouse is a spontaneous model of type 1 diabetes with a strong genetic component that maps to the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) region of the genome . A specific proteasome defect has been identified in NOD mouse in select lymphocytic and monocytic lineages that results from down-regulation of expression of the proteasome subunit LMP2 , which is encoded by a gene in the MHC genomic region . This defect prevents the proteolytic processing required for the production and activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , which plays important roles in immune and inflammatory responses , as well as increases the susceptibility of the affected cells to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) . The novel role of the proteasome in dysfunction in autoimmunity is presented and documented to be both tissue and developmental stage specific . We propose a role of the proteasome as a step in disease pathogenesis and tissue targeting .",gene
"Down-regulation of TDT transcription in CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) thymocytes by Ikaros proteins in direct competition with an Ets activator . Ikaros is a unique regulator of lymphopoiesis that associates with pericentromeric heterochromatin and has been implicated in heritable gene inactivation . Binding and competition experiments demonstrate that Ikaros dimers compete with an Ets activator for occupancy of the lymphocyte-specific TdT promoter . Mutations that selectively disrupt Ikaros binding to an integrated TdT promoter had no effect on promoter function in a CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) thymocyte line . However , these mutations abolished down-regulation on differentiation , providing evidence that Ikaros plays a direct role in repression . Reduced access to restriction enzyme cleavage suggested that chromatin alterations accompany down-regulation . The Ikaros-dependent down-regulation event and the observed chromatin alterations appear to precede pericentromeric repositioning . Current models propose that the functions of Ikaros should be disrupted by a small isoform that retains the dimerization domain and lacks the DNA-binding domain . Surprisingly , in the CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) thymocyte line , overexpression of a small Ikaros isoform had no effect on differentiation or on the pericentromeric targeting and DNA-binding properties of Ikaros . Rather , the small isoform assembled into multimeric complexes with DNA-bound Ikaros at the pericentromeric foci . The capacity for in vivo multimer formation suggests that interactions between Ikaros dimers bound to the TdT promoter and those bound to pericentromeric repeat sequences may contribute to the pericentromeric repositioning of the inactive gene .",gene
"Type I interferons and IL-12 : convergence and cross-regulation among mediators of cellular immunity . Therapeutic use of type I IFN ( IFN-alpha/beta ) has become common . Many of the diverse diseases targeted are marked by pathogenetic abnormalities in cell-mediated immunity ( CMI ) , these cellular immune responses either causing injury to the host , lacking sufficient vigor for virus or tumor clearance , or both . In general , therapeutic efficacy is limited . It is thus notable that the pleiotropic effects of type I IFN on CMI remain poorly understood . We characterized the effects of type I IFN on the production of IL-12 , the central immunoregulatory cytokine of the CD4 ( + ) T cell arm of CMI . We show that type I IFN are potent inhibitors of IL-12 production by human monocytes/macrophages . The underlying mechanism involves transcriptional inhibition of the IL-12p40 gene , marked by down-regulation of PU.1 binding activity at the upstream Ets site of the IL-12p40 promoter . Type I IFN have previously been shown to be able to substitute for IL-12 in driving IFN-gamma production from T and NK cells . The ability of IFN-alpha/beta to suppress IL-12 production while up-regulating IFN-gamma production suggests a possible mechanistic basis for the difficulties of employing these cytokines in diseases involving abnormalities of CMI .",gene
"Nuclear factor-kappaB suppressive and inhibitor-kappaB stimulatory effects of troglitazone in obese patients with type 2 diabetes : evidence of an antiinflammatory action ? It has been shown recently that troglitazone exerts an anti-inflammatory effect , in vitro , and in experimental animals . To test these properties in humans , we investigated the effect of troglitazone on the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB and its inhibitory protein IkappaB in mononuclear cells ( MNC ) and plasma soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 , and C-reactive protein . We also examined the effect of troglitazone on reactive oxygen species generation , p47 ( phox ) subunit expression , 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid ( 9-HODE ) , 13-HODE , o-tyrosine , and m-tyrosine in obese patients with type 2 diabetes . Seven obese patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with troglitazone ( 400 mg/day ) for 4 weeks . Blood samples were obtained at weekly intervals . Nuclear factor-kappaB binding activity in MNC nuclear extracts was significantly inhibited after troglitazone treatment at week 1 and continued to be inhibited up to week 4 . On the other hand , IkappaB protein levels increased significantly after troglitazone treatment at week 1 , and this increase persisted throughout the study . Plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 concentrations did not decrease significantly after troglitazone treatment , although there was a trend toward inhibition . Reactive oxygen species generation by polymorphonuclear cells and MNC , p47 ( phox ) subunit protein quantities , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 , and C-reactive protein levels decreased significantly after troglitazone intake . 13-HODE/linoleic acid and 9-HODE/linoleic acid ratios also decreased after troglitazone intake . However , o-tyrosine/phenylalanine and",gene
m-tyrosine/phenylalanine ratios did not change significantly . These data show that troglitazone has profound antiinflammatory effects in addition to antioxidant effects in obese type 2 diabetics ; these effects may be relevant to the recently described beneficial antiatherosclerotic effects of troglitazone at the vascular level .,gene
"OX40 stimulation by gp34/OX40 ligand enhances productive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection . OX40 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor superfamily and known to be an important costimulatory molecule expressed on activated T cells . To investigate the role of costimulation of OX40 in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection by its natural ligand , gp34 , the OX40-transfected ACH-2 cell line , ACH-2/OX40 , chronically infected with HIV-1 , was cocultured with paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) -fixed gp34-transfected mouse cell line , SV-T2/gp34 . The results showed that HIV-1 production was strongly induced . This was followed by apparent apoptosis , and both processes were specifically inhibited by the gp34 -specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody 5A8 . Endogenous TNF alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and TNF-beta production were not involved in the enhanced HIV-1 production . Furthermore , enhanced HIV-1 transcription in gp34 -stimulated ACH-2/OX40 cells was dependent on the kappa B site of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat , and the OX40-gp34 interaction activated NF-kappa B consisting of p50 and p65 subunits . When primary activated CD4 ( + ) T cells acutely infected with HIV-1 ( NL4-3 ) ( CXCR4-using T-cell-line-tropic ) were cocultured with PFA-fixed gp34 ( + ) human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-bearing MT-2 cells or SV-T2/gp34 cells , HIV-1 production was also markedly enhanced . The enhancement was again significantly inhibited by 5A8 . The present study first shows that OX40-gp34 interaction stimulates HIV-1 expression and suggests that OX40 triggering by gp34 may play an important role in enhancing HIV-1 production in both acutely and latently infected CD4 ( + ) T cells in vivo .",gene
"Troglitazone , a PPARgamma ligand , inhibits osteopontin gene expression in human monocytes/macrophage THP-1 cells . Peroxizome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARgamma ) is a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors that regulate adipocyte differentiation . Recent studies indicate that liganded PPARgamma not only promotes differentiation but also inhibits the activation of macrophages . Osteopontin , a component of extracellular matrix , is synthesized by macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques . In this study , we examined whether PPARgamma ligand regulates osteopontin gene expression in THP-1 cells , a cell line derived from human monocytic leukemia cells which can differentiate to macrophage upon stimulation with phorbol ester PMA . Northern blot analysis showed that osteopontin expression is markedly induced in response to PMA . Troglitazone , a PPARgamma ligand , dramatically attenuated the PMA-induced osteopontin expression . Transient transfection assays of the human osteopontin promoter/luciferase construct which contains a 5'-flanking region between -1500 and +87 relative to the transcription start site demonstrate that either treatment with troglitazone or cotransfection of PPARgamma expression vector inhibits osteopontin promoter activity . These data indicate that troglitazone reduces osteopontin gene expression at transcriptional level through PPARgamma activation , and suggest the role of troglitazone in inhibiting the ability of macrophages to produce extracellular matrix , which is particularly relevant to atherosclerotic plaque formation .",gene
"Transcription factor NF-kappa B regulates Ig lambda light chain gene rearrangement . The tissue- and stage-specific assembly of Ig and TCR genes is mediated by a common V ( D ) J recombinase complex in precursor lymphocytes . Directed alterations in the accessibility of V , D , and J gene segments target the recombinase to specific Ag receptor loci . Accessibility within a given locus is regulated by the functional interaction of transcription factors with cognate enhancer elements and correlates with the transcriptional activity of unrearranged gene segments . As demonstrated in our prior studies , rearrangement of the Igkappa locus is regulated by the inducible transcription factor NF-kappaB . In contrast to the Igkappa locus , known transcriptional control elements in the Iglambda locus lack functional NF-kappaB binding sites . Consistent with this observation , the expression of assembled Iglambda genes in mature B cells has been shown to be NF-kappaB independent . Nonetheless , we now show that specific repression of NF-kappaB inhibits germline transcription and recombination of Iglambda gene segments in precursor B cells . Molecular analyses indicate that the block in NF-kappaB impairs Iglambda rearrangement at the level of recombinase accessibility . In contrast , the activities of known Iglambda promoter and enhancer elements are unaffected in the same cellular background . These findings expand the range of NF-kappaB action in precursor B cells beyond Igkappa to include the control of recombinational accessibility at both L chain loci . Moreover , our results strongly suggest the existence of a novel Iglambda regulatory element that is either directly or indirectly activated by NF-kappaB during the early stages of B cell development .",gene
"Transcription factor STAT5A is a substrate of Bruton 's tyrosine kinase in B cells . STAT5A is a molecular regulator of proliferation , differentiation , and apoptosis in lymphohematopoietic cells . Here we show that STAT5A can serve as a functional substrate of Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) . Purified recombinant BTK was capable of directly binding purified recombinant STAT5A with high affinity ( K ( d ) = 44 nm ) , as determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore biosensor system . BTK was also capable of tyrosine-phosphorylating ectopically expressed recombinant STAT5A on Tyr ( 694 ) both in vitro and in vivo in a Janus kinase 3 -independent fashion . BTK phosphorylated the Y665F , Y668F , and Y682F , Y683F mutants but not the Y694F mutant of STAT5A . STAT5A mutations in the Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) and SH3 domains did not alter the BTK -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation . Recombinant BTK proteins with mutant pleckstrin homology , SH2 , or SH3 domains were capable of phosphorylating STAT5A , whereas recombinant BTK proteins with SH1/kinase domain mutations were not . In pull-down experiments , only full-length BTK and its SH1/kinase domain ( but not the pleckstrin homology , SH2 , or SH3 domains ) were capable of binding STAT5A . Ectopically expressed BTK kinase domain was capable of tyrosine-phosphorylating STAT5A both in vitro and in vivo . BTK -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of ectopically expressed wild type ( but not Tyr ( 694 ) mutant ) STAT5A enhanced its DNA binding activity . In BTK -competent chicken B cells , anti-IgM-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 protein was prevented by pretreatment with the BTK inhibitor LFM-A13 but not by",gene
"pretreatment with the JAK3 inhibitor HI-P131 . B cell antigen receptor ligation resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in BTK -deficient chicken B cells reconstituted with wild type human BTK but not in BTK -deficient chicken B cells reconstituted with kinase-inactive mutant BTK . Similarly , anti-IgM stimulation resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A in BTK -competent B cells from wild type mice but not in BTK -deficient B cells from XID mice . In contrast to B cells from XID mice , B cells from JAK3 knockout mice showed a normal STAT5A phosphorylation response to anti-IgM stimulation . These findings provide unprecedented experimental evidence that BTK plays a nonredundant and pivotal role in B cell antigen receptor-mediated STAT5A activation in B cells",gene
"Role of T-bet in commitment of TH1 cells before IL-12 -dependent selection . How cytokines control differentiation of helper T ( TH ) cells is controversial . We show that T-bet , without apparent assistance from interleukin 12 ( IL-12 ) / STAT4 , specifies TH1 effector fate by targeting chromatin remodeling to individual interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) alleles and by inducing IL-12 receptor beta2 expression . Subsequently , it appears that IL-12 / STAT4 serves two essential functions in the development of TH1 cells : as growth signal , inducing survival and cell division ; and as trans-activator , prolonging IFN-gamma synthesis through a genetic interaction with the coactivator , CREB-binding protein . These results suggest that a cytokine does not simply induce TH fate choice but instead may act as an essential secondary stimulus that mediates selective survival of a lineage .",gene
"Stat6 is necessary and sufficient for IL-4 's role in Th2 differentiation and cell expansion . IL-4 plays a critical role in the differentiation of T CR-stimulated naive CD4 T cells to the Th2 phenotype . In response to IL-4 , the IL-4R activates a set of phosphotyrosine binding domain-containing proteins , including insulin receptor substrate 1/2 , Shc , and IL-4R interacting protein , as well as Stat6 . Stat6 has been shown to be required for Th2 differentiation . To determine the roles of the phosphotyrosine binding adaptors in Th2 differentiation , we prepared a retrovirus containing a mutant of the human ( h ) IL-4R alpha-chain , Y497F , which is unable to recruit these adaptors . The mutant hIL-4Ralpha , as well as the wild-type ( WT ) hIL-4Ralpha , was introduced into naive CD4 T cells . Upon hIL-4 stimulation , Y497F worked as well as the WT hIL-4Ralpha in driving Th2 differentiation , as measured by Gata3 up-regulation and IL-4 production . Furthermore , IL-4-driven cell expansion was also normal in the cells infected with Y497F , although cells infected with Y497F were not capable of phosphorylating insulin receptor substrate 2 . These results suggest that the signal pathway mediated by Y497 is dispensable for both IL-4 -driven Th2 differentiation and cell expansion . Both WT and Y497F hIL-4Ralpha lose the ability to drive Th2 differentiation and cell expansion in Stat6-knockout CD4 T cells . A constitutively activated form of Stat6 introduced into CD4 T cells resulted in both Th2 differentiation and enhanced cell expansion . Thus , activated Stat6 is necessary and sufficient to mediate both IL-4 -driven Th2 differentiation and cell expansion in CD4 T cells .",gene
"The effect of HIV-1 regulatory proteins on cellular genes : derepression of the IL-2 promoter by Tat . In HIV-infected individuals dysregulation of the immune system is characterized by severe disorders of the cytokine network . Increase secretion of IL-2 , the major T cell growth and differentiation cytokine , may play a decisive role in sensitization of T cells for activation induced apoptosis and indirect death of activated T cells through augmented virus replication . We investigated the cause of enhanced IL-2 secretion and found that the HIV Tat induces this effect . We demonstrate that increased IL-2 secretion is due to Tat -enhanced IL-2 promoter activation . Tat derepresses and activates the distal AP-1 site ( position -185 to -177 ) in the IL-2 promoter . In nonstimulated T cells a repressor complex containing NF-IL6 , JunB , c-Fos and Fra-1 is formed on the AP-1 ( IL-2/d ) site and represses IL-2 promoter activity . After T cell activation , a heterodimeric activator containing p65 and c-Jun binds to the AP-1 ( IL-2/d ) site . HIV Tat enhances activation of NF-kappaB and consequently , activates the AP-1 ( IL-2/d ) site . Our data provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which HIV Tat dysregulates IL-2 production and therefore may contribute to the HIV-1 infection in a way yet to be clarified .",gene
"Transforming growth factor-beta1 interferes with thrombopoietin-induced signal transduction in megakaryoblastic and erythroleukemic cells . OBJECTIVE : Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) and transforming growth factor-beta ( 1 ) ( TGF-beta ( 1 ) ) have been shown to exert opposite effects on proliferation and megakaryocytic differentiation of hematopoietic cells . To determine whether TGF-beta ( 1 ) interferes directly with TPO -induced signal transduction in hematopoietic cells , we compared the regulatory effects in the TPO -responsive cell lines Mo-7e and HEL . MATERIALS AND METHODS : The cells were stimulated by 100 ng/mL TPO and/or 100 ng/mL TGF-beta1 and analyzed for proliferation ( 3H thymidine incorporation ) , viability ( trypan blue exclusion ) , and protein expression and phosphorylation ( Western blot ) . RESULTS : TPO enhanced the proliferation of Mo-7e cells as determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation , whereas TGF-beta1 suppressed baseline cell growth and antagonized the proliferative effect of TPO . TPO -induced proliferation also was reduced by a specific inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway ( PD098059 ) , which inhibits activation of the MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( ERK ) ERK1 and ERK2 , and AG490 , an inhibitor of Janus kinase-2 , which completely blocked TPO -induced proliferation . As demonstrated by Western blotting , TGF-beta1 reduced the TPO -stimulated ERK1 / ERK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation in Mo-7e and HEL cells . This effect was completely reversed by preincubation with a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor ( Na3VO4 ) , which suggests that TGF-beta1 activated a phosphatase . Although STAT3 also was activated by TPO , STAT3 activation remained unaltered by TGF-beta1 . CONCLUSION : Taken together , these data suggest that TGF-beta1 modulates",gene

"Invariant chain induces B cell maturation by activating a TAF ( II ) 105-NF-kappaB -dependent transcription program . Early stages of B cell development occur in the bone marrow , resulting in formation of immature B cells . From there these immature cells migrate to the spleen where they differentiate to mature cells . This final maturation step is crucial for the B cells to become responsive to antigens and to participate in the immune response . Recently , invariant chain ( Ii ) , a major histocompatibility complex class II chaperone , as well as the transcription factors c-Rel and p65/RelA , were found to play a role in the final antigen-independent differentiation stage of B cells in the spleen . In this study , we investigated a possible link between Ii -dependent B cell maturation and the NF-kappaB pathway . Our studies indicate that Ii -induced B cell maturation involves activation of transcription mediated by the NF-kappaB p65/RelA homodimer and requires the B cell-enriched coactivator TBP-associated factor ( II ) 105 .",gene
"Androgens indirectly accelerate thymocyte apoptosis . Apoptotic processes , or the disturbance of the natural regulation of these processes , may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases ( AID ) . Women are , in general , more susceptible than men to develop AID like rheumatoid arthritis . Androgens and glucocorticoids , in contrast to oestrogens , have favourable effects in AID models as well as in human AID . It is known that glucocorticoids ( GC ) , used for treatment of AID , increase apoptosis in the thymus resulting in decreased numbers of CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes . It was asked whether androgens , in contrast to oestrogens , exert their favourable effects in the treatment of AID by a mechanism comparable to that described for GC by eliminating the apoptosis prone CD4+ CD8+ population in the thymus . Although both androgens and oestrogens proved thymolytic , a significantly decreased percentage of CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes was observed by flow cytometry after treatment of mice with the androgen methyltestosterone , but not with the oestrogen ethinylestradiol . To investigate whether the observed thymolytic effects were due to the presence of hormone receptors on thymocytes , cells were isolated from the thymus and incubated with androgens or oestrogens to measure apoptosis . Several techniques were used to determine thymocyte apoptosis in vitro , but no enhanced apoptotic signal was observed . Using the very sensitive TUNEL assay , no direct effect of androgens on thymocytes in vitro could be observed . This is in sharp contrast to the high signal observed with GC . Therefore , upon in vivo androgen treatment , other cells containing androgen receptors than thymocytes are probably involved in inducing the increase in thymic apoptosis . To study the role of the androgen receptor on thymocyte apoptosis , androgen receptor mutant ( Tfm/Y ) mice were treated with androgens . No alterations of thymocyte subpopulations were seen , suggesting that changes in the percentage of CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes after administration of androgens depend",gene

"Inhibition of the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappaB in CD4 T cells by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligands . The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) , a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily , is essential for adipocyte differentiation and glucose homeostasis . PPARgamma has been found recently to regulate macrophage activation in response to mitogens and inflammation . Our study shows PPARgamma to be preferentially expressed in the nuclei of resting T cells and to increase upon activation of T cells by either anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 or phorbol myristyl acetate ( PMA ) . We also found the PPARgamma ligand ciglitizone to attenuate the activation of T cells by inhibiting cytokine gene expression and anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 or PMA-induced proliferative responses . Inhibition of both the proliferative response and inflammatory cytokine expression in CD4 T cells was correlated with suppression of the activated transcription factors AP1 and NF-kappaB . PPARgamma ligands also strongly inhibited SEA-induced Vbeta3 T cell activation in vivo . These results , together with previous findings of the inhibitory effect of PPARgamma ligands on activated macrophages , provide clear evidence for PPARgamma as a negative regulator of the inflammatory activation of both macrophage and T cells . PPARgamma may thus be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmunity .",gene
"A prominent role for activator protein-1 in the transcription of the human 2B4 ( CD244 ) gene in NK cells . The cell surface glycoprotein 2B4 ( CD244 ) of the Ig superfamily is involved in the regulation of NK and T lymphocyte functions . We have recently identified CD48 as the high affinity counterreceptor for 2B4 in both mice and humans . The cytoplasmic domain of 2B4 associates with src homology 2 domain-containing protein or signaling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated protein , whose mutation is the underlying genetic defect in the X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome . In this study , we report the molecular cloning and characterization of the human 2B4 ( h2B4 ) promoter . Through primer extension analysis , we found that the transcription of the h2B4 gene initiates at multiple start sites . We isolated h2B4 genomic clones and PCR amplified the 5 ' untranslated region containing the promoter elements . We have identified a functional AP-1 site that lies between ( -106 to -100 ) through transient transfection analysis in YT cells , a human NK cell line . EMSAs with Abs specific for various protein factors of the AP-1 family revealed that multiple members of the Jun family are involved in the regulation of the h2B4 gene . Mutation of the AP-1 site not only abolishes protein/DNA interactions but also promoter activity . These results demonstrate a significant role for AP-1 in the transcriptional regulation of the h2B4 gene .",gene
"Functional correction of FA-C cells with FANCC suppresses the expression of interferon gamma-inducible genes . Because hematopoietic cells derived from Fanconi anemia ( FA ) patients of the C-complementation group ( FA-C ) are hypersensitive to the inhibitory effects of interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) , the products of certain IFNgamma-inducible genes known to influence hematopoietic cell survival were quantified . High constitutive expression of the IFNgamma-inducible genes , IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 gamma subunit ( ISGF3gamma ) , IFN regulatory factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) , and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 ( WAF1 ) was found in FANCC mutant B lymphoblasts , low-density bone marrow cells , and murine embryonic fibroblasts . Paradoxically , these cells do not activate signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) 1 properly . In an attempt to clarify mechanisms by which FA-C cells overexpress IFNgamma-inducible genes in the face of defective STAT1 phosphorylation , it was reasoned that decreased levels of activated STAT1 might result in reduced expression of a hematopoietic IFNgamma-responsive protein that normally modulates expression of other IFNgamma-responsive genes . Levels of the IFNgamma -inducible factor IFN consensus sequence binding protein ( ICSBP ) , a negative trans-acting regulator of some IFNgamma-inducible genes , were quantified . ICSBP levels were reduced in FA-C B lymphoblasts and MEFs . However , enforced expression of ICSBP failed to down-regulate IRF-1 , ISGF3gamma , and p21 ( WAF1 ) . Thus , the FANCC protein functions to modulate expression of a family of genes that in normal cells are inducible only by specific environmental cues for apoptosis or mitogenic inhibition , but it does so independently of the classic IFN-STAT1 pathway and is not the direct result of reduced ICSBP expression .",gene
"A genetic investigation of E2A function in lymphocyte development . Lymphocytes are derived from hematopoietic stem cells ( HSC ) following a series of regulated differentiation events . Multipotent HSCs become committed to the B cell lineage in bone marrow and the T cell lineage in the thymus after receiving appropriate signals from the corresponding microenvironment . These committed lymphoid cells must then undergo V ( D ) J recombination at the immunoglobulin gene or T cell receptor gene locus resulting in clonal production of functional B or T lymphocytes , respectively . Lymphocyte commitment and differentiation are accompanied by programmed gene expression or repression events which are driven by lineage and stage specific transcription factors . The basic-helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors encoded by the E2A gene are involved in several differentiation events during B and T cell development , including lineage commitment , initiation of V ( D ) J recombination , and antigen receptor mediated proliferation and differentiation . Several recent reviews have provided a comprehensive discussion of biochemical , cellular , and genetic research on E2A function in lymphocyte development ( 1 , 2 ) . Here , we only discuss some of the genetic approaches our laboratory ( except where it is noted ) has undertaken to investigate the molecular pathways mediated by E2A transcription factors in lymphocyte development",gene
"D609 inhibits ionizing radiation-induced oxidative damage by acting as a potent antioxidant . Tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate ( D609 ) has been extensively studied in biological systems and exhibits a variety of biological functions , including antiviral , antitumor , and anti-inflammatory activities . Most of these activities have been largely attributed to the inhibitory effect of D609 on phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C . However , as a xanthate derivative , D609 is a strong electrolyte and readily dissociates to xanthate anions and cations of alkali metals in solution . Xanthate anions and protonated xanthic acid contain a free thiol moiety and are highly reductive . This implies that D609 and other xanthate derivatives may function as potent antioxidants . Indeed , we found that D609 inhibited the Fenton reaction-induced oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123 in a dose-dependent manner similar to that of pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate , a well known antioxidant . In addition , D609 inhibited the formation of the alpha-phenyl-tert-butylnitrone-free radical spin adducts and lipid peroxidation of synaptosomal membranes by the Fenton reagents . Furthermore , preincubation of lymphocytes with D609 resulted in a significant diminution of ionizing radiation ( IR ) -induced 1 ) production of reactive oxygen species ; 2 ) decrease in intracellular reduced glutathione ; 3 ) oxidative damage to proteins and lipids ; and 4 ) activation of nuclear factor-kappaB . Moreover , when D609 ( 50 mg/kg i.v. ) was administered to mice 10 min prior to total body IR ( 6.5 and 8.5 Gy ) , it protected the mice from IR-induced lethality . Thus , these results indicate that D609 is a potent antioxidant and has the ability to inhibit IR-induced cellular oxidative stress .",gene
"Inhibition of AP-1 by the glucocorticoid-inducible protein GILZ . The immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids arise largely by inhibition of cytokine gene expression , which has been ascribed to interference between the glucocorticoid receptor and transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-kappa B as well as by competition for common coactivators . Here we show that glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of interleukin-2 mRNA expression in activated normal T cells required new protein synthesis , suggesting that this phenomenon is secondary to expression of glucocorticoid-regulated genes . One of the most prominent glucocorticoid-induced genes is glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper ( GILZ ) , which has been reported to inhibit activation-induced up-regulation of Fas ligand ( FasL ) mRNA . Indeed , transient expression of GILZ in Jurkat T cells blocked induction of a reporter construct driven by the FasL promoter . This could be accounted for by GILZ -mediated inhibition of Egr-2 and Egr-3 , NFAT/AP-1 -inducible transcription factors that bind a regulatory element in the FasL promoter and up-regulate FasL expression . GILZ also potently inhibited AP-1-driven and IL-2 promoter-driven reporter constructs , and recombinant GILZ specifically interacted with c-Fos and c-Jun in vitro and inhibited the binding of active AP-1 to its target DNA . Whereas homodimerization of GILZ required the presence of its leucine zipper , the interaction with c-Fos and c-Jun occurred through the N-terminal 60-amino acid region of GILZ . Thus , GILZ represents a glucocorticoid-induced gene product that can inhibit a variety of activation-induced events , at least in part by direct interference with AP-1 , and is therefore a candidate for a mediator of glucocorticoid-induced immunosuppression .",gene
"Pharmacokinetic differences between a T cell-tolerizing and a T cell-activating peptide . Vaccination with a peptide representing a CTL epitope from the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) 16 E7 protein induces a specific CTL response that prevents the outgrowth of HPV16 E7-expressing tumors . In contrast , vaccination with a peptide encoding an adenovirus type 5 ( Ad5 ) E1A CTL epitope results in CTL tolerance and enhanced growth of an Ad5 E1A-expressing tumor . It is unclear why these peptides induce such opposite effects . To determine whether a difference in pharmacokinetics can explain the functional contrasts , tritiated Ad5 E1A and HPV16 E7 peptides were injected into mice . Results show that the tolerizing peptide spread through the body 16 times faster than the activating peptide and was cleared at least 2 times faster . The HPV16 E7 peptide kinetics correlated with the kinetics of HPV16 E7 -specific CTL induction . In contrast , Ad5 E1A peptide injection resulted in physical deletion of preexisting Ad5 E1A -specific CTLs within 24 h after injection . This tolerization occurred at the time when the peptide reached its maximum peptide concentration in the organs . These data suggest that ubiquitous expression of the tolerizing Ad5 E1A peptide within a short period of time causes activation-induced cell death of Ad5 E1A -specific CTLs . Therefore , information on the pharmacokinetics of peptides is vital for the safety and efficacy of peptide-based vaccines .",gene
"Smad3 and Smad4 mediate transforming growth factor-beta1 -induced IgA expression in murine B lymphocytes . Transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -beta1 is well established as a critical IgA isotype switching factor and Smad molecules have been reported to act as transducers and transcriptional factors in the expression of TGF-beta1 -targeted genes . We examined the involvement of Smad proteins in TGF-beta1 -induced IgA expression . First , we found that TGF-beta1 significantly increases endogenous germ-line ( GL ) alpha transcripts by LPS-stimulated CH12.LX.4933 ( mu ( + ) ) B lymphoma cells . To investigate its signaling mechanisms , the lymphoma cell line was transfected with pFL3 that contains the TGF-beta-responsive element of the GLalpha promoter , and stimulated with TGF-beta1 . Similar to endogenous GLalpha transcripts , TGF-beta1 induces GLalpha promoter activity and overexpression of Smad3 markedly enhances the promoter activity . This activity is further augmented by cotransfected Smad4 . On the other hand , Smad7 substantially abrogates the synergistic effect of Smad3/4 on GLalpha promoter activity . In addition , overexpression of Smad3/4 enhances TGF-beta1 -induced endogenous GLalpha transcripts in normal spleen B cell s . Finally , in the presence of TGF-beta1 , overexpression of Smad3/4 selectively increases both surface IgA expression and IgA production . The results from the present study indicate that Smad3 , Smad4 , and Smad7 , at least in part , serve as mediators linking TGF-beta1 to transcriptional regulation of IgA switching related gene and regulation of IgA class switching .",gene
"The translesion DNA polymerase zeta plays a major role in Ig and bcl-6 somatic hypermutation . Ig somatic mutations would be introduced by a polymerase ( pol ) while repairing DNA outside main DNA replication .

Upon B cell receptor ( BCR ) engagement and coculture with activated CD4+ T cells , these lymphocytes upregulated pol zeta , downregulated pol eta , and mutated the Ig and bcl-6 genes . Inhibition of the pol zeta REV3 catalytic subunit by specific phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides impaired Ig and bcl-6 hypermutation and UV damage-induced DNA mutagenesis , without affecting cell cycle or viability . Thus , pol zeta plays a critical role in Ig and bcl-6 hypermutation , perhaps facilitated by the downregulation of pol eta .",gene
"Molecular mechanism of cell cycle progression induced by the oncogene product Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type I . The trans-activator protein Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) plays an important role in the development of adult T-cell leukemia through , at least in part , its ability to stimulate cell growth . We previously reported that Tax induced cell cycle progression from G0/G1 phase to S and G2/M phases in human T-cell line Kit 225 cells . To elucidate molecular mechanism of Tax -induced cell cycle progression , we systematically examined the effects of Tax on biochemical events associated with cell cycle progression . Introduction of Tax into resting Kit 225 cells induced activation of the G1/S transition regulation cascade consisting of activation of cyclin dependent kinase 2 ( CDK2 ) and CDK4 , phosphorylation of the Rb family proteins and an increase in free E2F . The kinase activation was found to result from Tax -induced expression of genes for cell cycle regulatory molecules including cyclin D2 , cyclin E , E2F1 , CDK2 , CDK4 and CDK6 , and Tax -induced reduction of CDK inhibitors p19 ( INK4d ) and p27 ( Kip1 ) . These modulations by Tax always paralleled the ability of Tax to activate the NF-kappaB transcription pathway . These results indicate the important role of Tax -mediated trans-activation of the genes for cell cycle regulatory molecules in Tax -induced cell cycle progression .",gene
"Cot kinase induces cyclooxygenase-2 expression in T cells through activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells . Cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) is induced in human T lymphocytes upon T cell receptor triggering . Here we report that Cot kinase , a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase involved in T cell activation , up-regulates COX-2 gene expression in Jurkat T cells . Induction of COX-2 promoter activity by Cot kinase occurred mainly through activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) . Mutation of the distal ( -105/-97 ) and proximal ( -76/-61 ) NFAT response elements in the COX-2 promoter abolished the activation induced by Cot kinase . Even more , coexpression of a dominant negative version of NFAT inhibited Cot kinase -mediated COX-2 promoter activation , whereas cotransfection of a constitutively active version of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin synergizes with Cot kinase in the up-regulation of COX-2 promoter -driven transcription . Strikingly , Cot kinase increased transactivation mediated by a GAL4-NFAT fusion protein containing the N-terminal transactivation domain of NFATp . In contrast to phorbol ester plus calcium ionophore A23187 , Cot kinase increases both COX-2 promoter activity and NFAT -mediated transactivation in a cyclosporin A-independent manner . These data indicate that Cot kinase up-regulates COX-2 promoter -driven transcription through the NFAT response elements , being the Cot kinase -induced NFAT -dependent transactivation presumably implicated in this up-regulation .",gene
"Positive and negative roles of the trans-acting T cell factor-1 for the acquisition of distinct Ly-49 MHC class I receptors by NK cells . Members of the Ly-49 gene family code for class I MHC-specific receptors that regulate NK cell function . Due to a combinatorial distribution of Ly-49 receptors , NK cells display considerable clonal heterogeneity . The acquisition of one Ly-49 receptor , Ly-49A is strictly dependent on the transcriptional trans-acting factor T cell-specific factor-1 ( TCF-1 ) . Indeed , TCF-1 binds to two sites in the Ly-49a promoter and regulates its activity , suggesting that the Ly-49a gene is a direct TCF-1 target . TCF-1 deficiency resulted in the altered usage of additional Ly-49 receptors . We show in this study , using TCF-1 beta ( 2 ) -microglobulin double-deficient mice , that these repertoire alterations are not due to Ly-49/MHC class I interactions . Our findings rather suggest a TCF-1 -dependent , cell autonomous effect on the acquisition of multiple Ly-49 receptors . Besides reduced receptor usage ( Ly-49A and D ) , we also observed no effect ( Ly-49C ) and significantly expanded ( Ly-49G and I ) receptor usage in the absence of TCF-1 . These effects did not in all cases correlate with the presence of TCF binding sites in the respective proximal promoter . Therefore , besides TCF-1 binding to the proximal promoter , Ly-49 acquisition may also be regulated by TCF-1 binding to more distant cis-acting elements and/or by regulating the expression of additional trans-acting factors . Consistent with the observed differential , positive or negative role of TCF-1 for Ly-49 receptor acquisition , reporter gene assays revealed the presence of an inducing as well as a repressing TCF site in certain proximal Ly-49 promoters . These findings reveal an important role of TCF-1 for the formation of the NK cell receptor repertoire .",gene
"Ligation of CD11b and CD11c beta ( 2 ) integrins by antibodies or soluble CD23 induces macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha ( MIP-1alpha ) and MIP-1beta production in primary human monocytes through a pathway dependent on nuclear factor-kappaB . Chemokines and adhesion molecules such as integrins play a major part in the trafficking , extravasation , and recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory sites . This study investigated the effects of beta ( 2 ) integrin engagement on chemokine production by freshly isolated human monocytes . We found that ligation of CD11b or CD11c but not CD11a alpha chains of beta ( 2 ) integrins by antibodies or soluble CD23 ( sCD23 ) fusion proteins rapidly induced transcription and secretion of interleukin 8 , macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) 1alpha , and MIP-1beta . Because the promoters of these chemokine genes contain kappaB binding sites , we assessed the possible role of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) in controlling induction of the genes through beta ( 2 ) integrin engagement . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that sCD23 or antibodies to CD11b or to CD11c up-regulated DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB . Activation of NF-kappaB was accompanied by degradation of its cytosolic inhibitor IkappaB-alpha . Blockade of depletion of IkappaB-alpha by proteasome inhibitors ( proteasome inhibitor I or acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal ) led to concomitant inhibition of NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity and expression of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta messenger RNA induced by beta ( 2 ) integrin ligation . These results suggest that triggering of CD11b or CD11c beta ( 2 ) integrin on primary human monocytes provides activation signals leading to nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and subsequent secretion of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta that may have an important role in recruitment of other inflammatory cells during initiation of an inflammatory response",gene

Interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) , a cytokine that exerts many pro-atherosclerotic effects in vivo , causes up-regulation of ACAT-1 mRNA in human blood monocyte-derived macrophages and macrophage-like cells but not in other cell types . To examine the molecular nature of this observation , we identified within the ACAT-1 P1 promoter a 159-base pair core region . This region contains 4 Sp1 elements and an IFN-gamma activated sequence ( GAS ) that overlaps with the second Sp1 element . In the monocytic cell line THP-1 cell , the combination of IFN-gamma and all-trans-retinoic acid ( a known differentiation agent ) enhances the ACAT-1 P1 promoter but not the P7 promoter . Additional experiments showed that all-trans-retinoic acid causes large induction of the transcription factor STAT1 , while IFN-gamma causes activation of STAT1 such that it binds to the GAS/Sp1 site in the ACAT-1 P1 promoter . Our work provides a molecular mechanism to account for the effect of IFN-gamma in causing transcriptional activation of ACAT-1 in",gene

"Inhaled nitric oxide down-regulates intrapulmonary nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury . OBJECTIVE : To examine whether inhaled nitric oxide ( NO ) affected the intrapulmonary production of NO , reactive oxygen species , and nuclear factor-kappaB in a lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced model of acute lung injury . DESIGN : Prospective , randomized , laboratory study . SETTING : Experimental laboratory at a biomedical institute . SUBJECTS : Twenty male rabbits weighing 2.5-3.5 kg . INTERVENTIONS : Saline or LPS ( 5 mg/kg of body weight ) was administered intravenously with or without NO inhalation ( 10 ppm ) in each group of five rabbits . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : LPS increased the lung leak index , the neutrophils and NO levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid , and NO levels produced by resting and stimulated alveolar macrophages . Inhaled NO decreased the lung leak index , the neutrophils and NO levels as measured by nitrite levels in the lavage fluid , and NO produced by the resting and stimulated alveolar macrophages . Inhaled NO also blocked the activities of reactive oxygen species and nuclear factor-kappaB binding to DNA in lavage cells and in alveolar macrophages . CONCLUSION : Inhaled NO attenuates LPS-induced acute lung injury , possibly by decreasing NO production in the lungs . The mechanism of reducing NO production resulting from inhaled NO may involve , in part , the activities of reactive oxygen species and/or nuclear factor-kappaB .",gene
"Treatment of allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness by antisense-induced local blockade of GATA-3 expression . Recent studies in transgenic mice have revealed that expression of a dominant negative form of the transcription factor GATA-3 in T cells can prevent T helper cell type 2 ( Th2 ) -mediated allergic airway inflammation in mice . However , it remains unclear whether GATA-3 plays a role in the effector phase of allergic airway inflammation and whether antagonizing the expression and/or function of GATA-3 can be used for the therapy of allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness . Here , we analyzed the effects of locally antagonizing GATA-3 function in a murine model of asthma . We could suppress GATA-3 expression in interleukin ( IL ) -4 -producing T cells in vitro and in vivo by an antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide overlapping the translation start site of GATA-3 , whereas nonsense control oligonucleotides were virtually inactive . In a murine model of asthma associated with allergic pulmonary inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in ovalbumin ( OVA ) -sensitized mice , local intranasal administration of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled GATA-3 antisense oligonucleotides led to DNA uptake in lung cells associated with a reduction of intracellular GATA-3 expression . Such intrapulmonary blockade of GATA-3 expression caused an abrogation of signs of lung inflammation including infiltration of eosinophils and Th2 cytokine production . Furthermore , treatment with antisense but not nonsense oligonucleotides induced a significant reduction of airway hyperresponsiveness in OVA-sensitized mice to levels comparable to saline-treated control mice , as assessed by both enhanced pause ( PenH ) responses and pulmonary resistance determined by body plethysmography . These data indicate a critical role for GATA-3 in the effector phase of a murine asthma model and suggest that local delivery of GATA-3 antisense oligonucleotides may be a novel approach for the treatment of airway",gene

"T helper-cell phenotype regulates atherosclerosis in mice under conditions of mild hypercholesterolemia . BACKGROUND : T cells are implicated in atherosclerosis , but little is known about the genetic control or molecular pathways , especially under conditions of mild hypercholesterolemia . METHODS AND RESULTS : BALB/c mice , making a CD4+ Th2 ( IL-4+ ) cell response , express both MHC class II antigens ( IA ( d ) , IE ( d ) ) and are atherosclerosis-resistant . C57Bl/6 mice produce a CD4+ Th1 ( interferon [ IFN ] gamma+ ) response , express IA ( b ) but no IE , and are atherosclerosis-prone . To evaluate T helper-cell phenotype in fatty streak formation , wild-type C57Bl/6 mice ( IA ( b ) +IE- ) and transgenic mice , either AB ( o ) , IA ( b ) -IE- ; ABEalpha , IA-IE ( k ) + ; or BL : TG : Ealpha , IA ( b ) +IE ( k ) + , were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 16 weeks and evaluated histomorphometrically for aortic lesions . Lesion size in AB ( o ) , ABEalpha , and BL : TG : Ealpha strains was decreased by 54 % , 79 % , and 82 % , respectively , compared with wild-type , correlating with decreased Th1 and increased Th2 expression and suggesting that T helper-cell phenotype is important in fatty lesion development . Decreasing Th1 cells by antibodies ( alpha-CD4 ) or cytokines ( IL-4 ) also caused > /=80 % reductions in lesion size . Immunohistology revealed IFN-gamma , but not IL-4 , colocalized with activated macrophages . Confirming these findings in a different mouse strain , BALB/c Stat 6 knockout mice ( Th2 cell-deficient ) developed aortic lesions comparable to C57Bl/6 mice on the same diet .",gene
"CONCLUSIONS : In mildly hypercholesterolemic C57Bl/6 mice , presence of IA ( b ) and absence of IE regulated CD4+ T helper-cell phenotype ; fatty lesions were proportional to IFNgamma+ Th1 cells in both C57Bl/6 and BALB/c strains . IFN-gamma may participate through macrophage activation , whereas IL-4 may act to limit Th1-cell response .",gene
"Requirement for p38 and p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinases in RAGE -mediated nuclear factor-kappaB transcriptional activation and cytokine secretion . Advanced glycation end product ( AGE ) activation of the signal-transducing receptor for AGE ( RAGE ) has been linked to a proinflammatory phenotypic change within cells . However , the precise intracellular signaling pathways involved have not been elucidated . We demonstrate here that human serum albumin modified with N ( varepsilon ) - ( carboxymethyl ) lysine ( CML ) , a major AGE adduct that progressively accumulates with aging , diabetes , and renal failure , induced nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB -driven reporter gene expression in human monocytic THP-1 cells . The NF-kappaB response was blocked with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the putative ligand-binding domain of RAGE , with anti- RAGE antiserum , and by coexpression of truncated receptors lacking the intracellular domain . Signal transduction from RAGE to NF-kappaB involved the generation of reactive oxygen species , since reporter gene expression was blocked with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine . CML-modified albumin produced rapid transient activation of tyrosine phosphorylation , extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 , and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , but not c-Jun NH ( 2 ) -terminal kinase . RAGE -mediated NF-kappaB activation was suppressed by the selective p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and by coexpression of a kinase-dead p38 dominant-negative mutant . Activation of NF-kappaB by CML-modified albumin increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines ( tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin-1beta , and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ) severalfold , and inhibition of p38 MAPK blocked these increases . These results indicate that p38 MAPK activation mediates RAGE -induced NF-kappaB -dependent secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and suggest that accelerated inflammation",gene

"Antigen-receptor cross-linking and lipopolysaccharide trigger distinct phosphoinositide 3-kinase -dependent pathways to NF-kappa B activation in primary B cells . The NF-kappaB/Rel transcription factors play an important role in the expression of genes involved in B cell development , differentiation and function . Nuclear NF-kappaB is induced in B cells by engagement of either the BCR or CD40 or by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . Despite the importance of NF-kappaB to B cell function , little is known about the signaling pathways leading to NF-kappaB activation . In this report we address the role of phosphoinositide 3'-kinase ( PI 3-kinase ) in BCR - and LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation using populations of primary murine resting B cells . Using the specific pharmacological inhibitors of PI 3-kinase , Wortmannin and LY294002 , we demonstrate that PI 3-kinase activity is vital for BCR -induced NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity . Furthermore , we show that this is achieved via protein kinase C -dependent degradation of IkappaBalpha . Similar analyses reveal that PI 3-kinase is also critical in triggering NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity and IkappaBalpha degradation following LPS stimulation . Interestingly , a PKC inhibitor which blocked the BCR -induced IkappaBalpha degradation had no effect on the degradation of IkappaBalpha after LPS stimulation . Taken together , our results indicate the involvement of PI 3-kinase in at least two distinct signaling pathways leading to activation of NF-kappaB in B cells .",gene
"Tetramer-guided epitope mapping : rapid identification and characterization of immunodominant CD4+ T cell epitopes from complex antigens . T cell responses to Ags involve recognition of selected peptide epitopes contained within the antigenic protein . In this report , we describe a new approach for direct identification of CD4+ T cell epitopes of complex Ags that uses human class II tetramers to identify reactive cells . With a panel of 60 overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of the VP16 protein , a major Ag for HSV-2 , we generated a panel of class II MHC tetramers loaded with peptide pools that were used to stain peripheral lymphocytes of an HSV-2 infected individual . With this approach , we identified four new DRA1*0101/DRB1*0401- and two DRA1*0101/DRB1*0404-restricted , VP16-specific epitopes . By using tetramers to sort individual cells , we easily obtained a large number of clones specific to these epitopes . Although DRA1*0101/DRB1*0401 and DRA1*0101/DRB1*0404 are structurally very similar , nonoverlapping VP16 epitopes were identified , illustrating high selectivity of individual allele polymorphisms within common MHC variants . This rapid approach to detecting CD4+ T cell epitopes from complex Ags can be applied to any known Ag that gives a T cell response .",gene
"Localized pancreatic NF-kappaB activation and inflammatory response in taurocholate-induced pancreatitis . Transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) is activated in cerulein pancreatitis and mediates cytokine expression . The role of transcription factor activation in other models of pancreatitis has not been established . Here we report upregulation of NF-kappaB and inflammatory molecules , and their correlation with local pancreatic injury , in a model of severe pancreatitis . Rats received intraductal infusion of taurocholate or saline , and the pancreatic head and tail were analyzed separately . NF-kappaB and activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) activation were assessed by gel shift assay , and mRNA expression of interleukin-6 , tumor necrosis factor-alpha , KC , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 , and inducible nitric oxide synthase was assessed by semiquantitative RT-PCR . Morphological damage and trypsin activation were much greater in the pancreatic head than tail , in parallel with a stronger activation of NF-kappaB and cytokine mRNA . Saline infusion mildly affected these parameters . AP-1 was strongly activated in both pancreatic segments after either taurocholate or saline infusion . NF-kappaB inhibition with N-acetylcysteine ameliorated the local inflammatory response . Correlation between localized NF-kappaB activation , cytokine upregulation , and tissue damage suggests a key role for NF-kappaB in the development of the inflammatory response of acute pancreatitis .",gene
"CD45 tyrosine phosphatase controls common gamma-chain cytokine -mediated STAT and extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation in activated human lymphoblasts : inhibition of proliferation without induction of apoptosis . The objective of this study was to test whether CD45 signals can influence signaling processes in activated human lymphoblasts . To this end , we generated lymphoblasts which proliferate in response to common gamma-chain cytokines , but readily undergo apoptosis after cytokine withdrawal . In experiments with the CD45R0 mAb UCHL-1 , but not control CD45 mAbs , we found significant inhibition of proliferation . Interestingly , the pan-CD45 mAb GAP8.3 , which is most effective in inhibition of OKT-3-mediated proliferation in quiescent lymphocytes , was ineffective in lymphoblasts . Addition of CD3 mAb OKT-3 had no influence on IL-2-mediated proliferation ( with or without UCHL-1 ) . In contrast , after addition of OKT-3 to IL-4 - and IL-7 -stimulated proliferation assays , UCHL-1 signals could not significantly alter cellular proliferation . We did not find induction of apoptosis following CD45R0 signaling . In Western blots using mAbs detecting phosphorylated STAT-3 , STAT-5 , STAT-6 , or extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 , we found that CD45R0 signaling could effectively diminish phosphorylation of these intracellular signaling components . Using RT-PCR , we found that CD45R0 signaling inhibited IL-2 mRNA production without major influence on IL-13 , IL-5 , or IFN-gamma mRNA levels . Costimulation with OKT-3 and IL-2 optimally induced secretion of IFN-gamma , TNF-alpha , and IL-5 , which was not decreased by CD45 signals . In conclusion , we illustrate that CD45R0 signals control early cytokine receptor-associated signaling processes and mRNA and DNA synthesis in activated human lymphoblasts . Furthermore , we show the existence of CD45 epitopes ( GAP8.3 ) , which are active and critical for signaling",gene

"Pax5 determines the identity of B cells from the beginning to the end of B-lymphopoiesis . Despite being one of the most intensively studied cell types , the molecular basis of B cell specification is largely unknown . The Pax5 gene encoding the transcription factor BSAP is required for progression of B-lymphopoiesis beyond the pro-B cell stage . Pax5-deficient pro-B cells are , however , not yet committed to the B-lymphoid lineage , but instead have a broad lymphomyeloid developmental potential . Pax5 appears to mediate B-lineage commitment by repressing the transcription of non-B-lymphoid genes and by simultaneously activating the expression of B-lineage-specific genes . Pax5 thus functions both as a transcriptional repressor and activator , depending on its interactions with corepressors of the Groucho protein family or with positive regulators such as the TATA-binding protein . Once committed to the B-lineage , B cells require Pax5 function to maintain their B-lymphoid identity throughout B cell development",gene
"Partners in transcription : NFAT and AP-1 . Combinatorial regulation is a powerful mechanism that enables tight control of gene expression , via integration of multiple signaling pathways that induce different transcription factors required for enhanceosome assembly . The four calcium-regulated transcription factors of the NFAT family act synergistically with AP-1 ( Fos/Jun ) proteins on composite DNA elements which contain adjacent NFAT and AP-1 binding sites , where they form highly stable ternary complexes to regulate the expression of diverse inducible genes . Concomitant induction of NFAT and AP-1 requires concerted activation of two different signaling pathways : calcium/calcineurin , which promotes NFAT dephosphorylation , nuclear translocation and activation ; and protein kinase C ( PKC ) /Ras , which promotes the synthesis , phosphorylation and activation of members of the Fos and Jun families of transcription factors . A fifth member of the NFAT family , NFAT5 , controls the cellular response to osmotic stress , by a mechanism that requires dimer formation and is independent of calcineurin or of interaction with AP-1 . Pharmacological interference with theNFAT : AP-1 interaction may be useful in selective manipulation of the immune response . Balanced activation of NFAT and AP-1 is known to be required for productive immune responses , but the role of NFAT : AP-1 interactions in other cell types and biological processes remains to be understood .",gene
"Cytokine production by Vgamma ( + ) -T-cell subsets is an important factor determining CD4 ( + ) -Th-cell phenotype and susceptibility of BALB/c mice to coxsackievirus B3-induced myocarditis . Two coxsackievirus B3 ( CVB3 ) variants ( H3 and H310A1 ) differ by a single amino acid mutation in the VP2 capsid protein . H3 induces severe myocarditis in BALB/c mice , but H310A1 is amyocarditic . Infection with H3 , but not H310A1 , preferentially activates Vgamma4 Vdelta4 cells , which are strongly positive for gamma interferon ( IFN-gamma ) , whereas Vgamma1 Vdelta4 cells are increased in both H3 and H310A1 virus-infected animals . Depletion of Vgamma1 ( + ) cells using monoclonal anti-Vgamma1 antibody enhanced myocarditis and CD4 ( + ) - , IFN-gamma ( + ) -cell responses in both H3- and H310A1-infected mice yet decreased the CD4 ( + ) - , IL-4 ( + ) -cell response .

Vgamma4 and Vgamma1 ( + ) T cells from Stat4ko mice expressed IL-4 but no or minimal IFN-gamma , whereas these cell populations derived from Stat6ko mice expressed IFN-gamma but no IL-4 .

"Plasmin -induced expression of cytokines and tissue factor in human monocytes involves AP-1 and IKKbeta -mediated NF-kappaB activation . It was previously shown that plasmin activates human peripheral monocytes in terms of lipid mediator release and chemotactic migration . Here it is demonstrated that plasmin induces proinflammatory cytokine release and tissue factor ( TF ) expression by monocytes . Plasmin 0.043 to 1.43 CTA U/mL , but not active site-blocked plasmin , triggered concentration-dependent expression of mRNA for interleukin-1alpha ( IL-1alpha ) , IL-1beta , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , and TF with maximum responses after 4 hours . Plasmin -mediated mRNA expression was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the lysine analogue trans-4- ( aminomethyl ) cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid ( t-AMCA ) . Increases in mRNA levels were followed by concentration- and time-dependent release of IL-1alpha , IL-1beta and TNF-alpha and by TF expression on monocyte surfaces . Neither cytokines nor TF could be detected when monocytes were preincubated with actinomycin D or cycloheximide . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated plasmin -induced activation of NF-kappaB ; DNA-binding complexes were composed of p50 , p65 , and c-Rel , as shown by supershift experiments . Nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB/Rel proteins coincided with IkappaBalpha degradation . At variance with endotoxic lipopolysaccharide , plasmin elicited the rapid degradation of another cytoplasmic NF-kappaB inhibitor , p105 . Proteolysis of NF-kappaB inhibitors was apparently due to transient activation of IkappaB kinase ( IKK ) beta that reached maximum activity at 1 hour after plasmin stimulation .

"STAT3 is constitutively active in some patients with Polycythemia rubra vera . OBJECTIVE : Polycythemia vera is a clonal stem cell disorder characterized by hyperproliferation of the erythroid , myeloid , and megakaryocytic lineages . While it has been shown that progenitor cells of P. vera patients are hypersensitive to several growth factors including erythropoietin , insulin-like growth factor-1 , thrombopoietin , interleukin-3 , and granulocyte/monocyte colony-stimulating factor , the molecular pathogenesis of this disease remains unknown . Growth factor hypersensitivity could be mediated by changes in signal transduction pathways . We therefore investigated a common downstream effector of cytokines , the signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STATs ) . A constitutive activation of STAT factors could explain the increased proliferation of P. vera cells even in the absence of growth factor stimulation . METHODS : Peripheral granulocytes from patients with P. vera and from healthy volunteers were assayed for STAT1 , 3 , and 5 DNA binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . RESULTS : Four of 14 P. vera patients analyzed showed constitutive STAT3 DNA binding in unstimulated peripheral granulocytes , while none of the 17 healthy volunteers tested did . None of the subjects showed constitutive STAT1 or STAT5 activity . Western blotting demonstrated that , in the three patients , STAT3 is constitutively phosphorylated on Tyr 705 , whereas it is unphosphorylated in the other patients and in controls . Interestingly , constitutive STAT3 activity did not correlate with the duration of disease or the treatment regimen . It was observed in a recently diagnosed patient and in two patients treated only with phlebotomy . CONCLUSION : Our data suggest that constitutive phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 is not a secondary event induced by mutagenizing agents or by prolonged hyperproliferation of hematopoietic cells , but rather represents a",gene

"Identification of phosphorylation sites for Bruton 's tyrosine kinase within the transcriptional regulator BAP/TFII-I . Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( Btk ) , a member of the Tec family of cytosolic kinases , is essential for B cell development and function . BAP/TFII-I , a protein implicated in transcriptional regulation , is associated with Btk in B cells and is transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine following B cell receptor engagement . BAP/TFII-I is a substrate for Btk in vitro and is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine upon coexpression with Btk in mammalian cells . In an effort to understand the physiologic consequences of BAP/TFII-I tyrosine phosphorylation following B cell receptor stimulation , site-directed mutagenesis and phosphopeptide mapping were used to locate the predominant sites of BAP/TFII-I phosphorylation by Btk in vitro . These residues , Tyr248 , Tyr357 , and Tyr462 , were also found to be the major sites for Btk -dependent phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I in vivo . Residues Tyr357 and Tyr462 are contained within the loop regions of adjacent helix-loop-helix-like repeats within BAP/TFII-I . Mutation of either Tyr248 , Tyr357 , or Tyr462 to phenylalanine reduced transcription from a c-fos promoter relative to wild-type BAP/TFII-I in transfected COS-7 cells , consistent with the interpretation that phosphorylation at these sites contributes to transcriptional activation . Phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I by Btk may link engagement of receptors such as surface immunoglobulin to modulation of gene expression .",gene

"A transcriptional block in the IL-2 promoter at the -150 AP-1 site in effector CD8+ T cells . Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that produce IL-2 in response to Ag recognition have been isolated . However , most effector CD8+ T cells recovered after exposure to Ag do not produce sufficient IL-2 to sustain growth , and depend on CD4+ T helper cells for this obligate growth factor . IL-2 expression in CD4+ T cells is primarily controlled at the level of transcription , but mechanisms restricting IL-2 production in CD8+ T cells have not been elucidated . To evaluate transcriptional regulation of the IL-2 gene in CD8+ T cells , we stably transfected reporter genes into Ag -specific CD8+ T cell clones . CD28+ CD8 ( + ) T cells unable to transcribe the IL-2 gene in response to antigenic stimulation had a block in transactivation of the -150 CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) /AP-1 site of the IL-2 promoter , but did transactivate the composite NFAT/AP-1 and OCT/AP-1 sites , and a consensus AP-1 motif . Mutation of the nonconsensus -150 AP-1 site to a consensus AP-1 site , or insertion of a CD28RE/AP-1 consensus site upstream of the native -150 CD28RE/AP-1 site restored transactivation of the altered promoter .

"Distinct BMI-1 and EZH2 expression patterns in thymocytes and mature T cells suggest a role for Polycomb genes in human T cell differentiation . BMI-1 and EZH2 Polycomb-group ( PcG ) proteins belong to two distinct protein complexes involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis . Using unique PcG-specific antisera and triple immunofluorescence , we found that mature resting peripheral T cells expressed BMI-1 , whereas dividing blasts were EZH2 ( + ) . By contrast , subcapsular immature double-negative ( DN ) ( CD4 ( - ) /CD8 ( - ) ) T cells in the thymus coexpressed BMI-1 and EZH2 or were BMI-1 single positive . Their descendants , double-positive ( DP ; CD4 ( + ) /CD8 ( + ) ) cortical thymocytes , expressed EZH2 without BMI-1 . Most EZH2 ( + ) DN and DP thymocytes were dividing , while DN BMI-1 ( + ) /EZH2 ( - ) thymocytes were resting and proliferation was occasionally noted in DN BMI-1 ( + ) /EZH2 ( + ) cells . Maturation of DP cortical thymocytes to single-positive ( CD4 ( + ) /CD8 ( - ) or CD8 ( + ) /CD4 ( - ) ) medullar thymocytes correlated with decreased detectability of EZH2 and continued relative absence of BMI-1 . Our data show that BMI-1 and EZH2 expression in mature peripheral T cells is mutually exclusive and linked to proliferation status , and that this pattern is not yet established in thymocytes of the cortex and medulla . T cell stage-specific PcG expression profiles suggest that PcG genes contribute to regulation of T cell differentiation . They probably reflect stabilization of cell type-specific gene expression and irreversibility of lineage choice . The difference in PcG expression between medullar thymocytes and mature interfollicular T cells indicates that additional maturation processes occur after thymocyte transportation from the thymus .",gene
"Stepwise lineage restriction of progenitors in lympho-myelopoiesis . It has long been controversial whether hematopoiesis progresses through ordered stages of determination as in embryonic development . This is due to the absence of a methodology capable of exactly determining the developmental potential of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells . The multilineage progenitor ( MLP ) assay enabled us to discriminate among seven types of hematopoietic progenitors , which are multipotent progenitor p-MTB ( capable of generating myeloid , T and B cells ) , bipotent progenitors p-MT , p-MB and p-TB , and unipotent progenitors p-M , p-T and p-B . Among these seven types , the p-TB type progenitor was found to be absent . These findings indicate that the process of lineage commitment proceeds through an ordered but not random process . By extending the area of investigation to include the erythroid lineage , more convincing evidence for the ordered process was obtained .

"Epstein-Barr Virus and its glycoprotein-350 upregulate IL-6 in human B-lymphocytes via CD21 , involving activation of NF-kappaB and different signaling pathways . Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a ubiquitous and highly immunotropic gamma herpesvirus that infects more than 90 % of humans worldwide . Its pathogenicity leads to a number of diseases including tumors that result from EBV 's ability to readily transform B-lymphocytes and , to a lesser extent , epithelial cells . EBV utilizes CD21/CR2 as its receptor on B cells to initiate the infection process . EBV binds to CR2 through its major envelope glycoprotein-350 ( gp350 ) and is also a remarkable immunomodulating agent . We had previously shown that EBV is capable of modulating the synthesis of a number of cytokines . We now show that while both purified recombinant gp350 ( rgp350 ) and EBV upregulate IL-6 mRNA synthesis in B cells , EBV-induced IL-6 gene activation occurs for a significantly longer period of time ( i.e. 12 hours for EBV as compared to 6 hours for rgp350 ) . Moreover , the half-life of EBV-induced IL-6 mRNA was also significantly longer ( 10 hours ) than that of mRNA induced by rgp350 ( about 6 hours ) . Both EBV and gp350 enhance the binding of the NF-kappaB transcription factor , as determined by band-shift and augment NF-kappaB -mediated activation of a CAT reporter plasmid . Furthermore , we demonstrate that while the activation of IL-6 gene expression by gp350 is mediated primarily by the protein kinase C pathway , EBV can mediate its effects through multiple signaling pathways . To our knowledge this is the first report showing that the binding of a herpesvirus envelope glycoprotein to CR2 on human B cells results in the activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor leading to the upregulation of IL-6 gene expression in these lymphocytes .

In a previous study , we found that treating transgenic Big Blue rats with the hepatocarcinogen N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene ( N-OH-AAF ) produced the same major DNA adduct in the target liver and the nontarget spleen lymphocytes and bone marrow cells , induced lacI mutants in the liver , and induced much lower frequencies of l acI and hprt mutants in spleen lymphocytes . In the present study , sequence analysis was conducted on lacI DNA and hprt cDNA from the mutants , to determine the mutational specificity of N-OH-AAF in the rat . All the mutation spectra from N-OH-AAF-treated rats differed significantly from corresponding mutation profiles from untreated animals ( P = 0.02 to P < 0.0001 ) . Although there were similarities among the mutational patterns derived from N-OH-AAF-treated rats ( e.g. , G : C -- > T : A transversion was the most common mutation in all mutation sets ) , there were significant differences in the patterns of basepair substitution and frameshift mutation between the liver and spleen lymphocyte lacI mutants ( P = 0.02 ) and between the spleen lymphocyte lacI and hprt mutants ( P = 0.04 ) . Also , multiplex PCR analysis of genomic DNA from the hprt mutants indicated that 12 % of mutants from treated rats had major deletions in the hprt gene ; no corresponding incidence of large deletions was evident among lacI mutations . All the mutation profiles reflect the general mutational specificity of the major DNA adduct formed by N-OH-AAF . The differences between N-OH-AAF mutation in the endogenous gene and transgene can be partially explained by the structures of the two genes . The tissue-specificity of the mutation spectra may contribute to targeting tumor formation to the liver . Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 37 : 203-214 , 2001 . Published 2001 Wiley-Liss , Inc .",gene
"Caspase -dependent cleavage of the hematopoietic specific adaptor protein Gads alters signalling from the T cell receptor . Gads is a SH2 and SH3 domain -containing , hematopoietic-specific adaptor protein that functions in signalling from the T cell receptor . Gads acts by linking SLP-76 , bound by the carboxy-terminal Gads SH3 domain , to tyrosine phosphorylated LAT which contains binding sites for the Gads SH2 domain . Gads is distinguished from Grb2 and the closely related Grap protein by the presence of a 120 amino acid unique region between the SH2 domain and the carboxy terminal SH3 domain . Here we demonstrate that the unique region of Gads contains a capase cleavage site . Induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes results in detectable Gads cleavage by 60 min . Gads cleavage is blocked in vivo by treating cells with a caspase 3 inhibitor . A putative caspase 3 cleavage site was identified within the unique region and mutation of this site prevented Gads cleavage in vitro , and in vivo . The Gads cleavage products retained the predicted binding specificity for SLP-76 and LAT . Expression of the Gads cleavage products in Jurkat T cells inhibited NFAT activation following TCR cross linking . These findings indicate that cleavage of Gads in vivo could function to alter signalling downstream of the T cell receptor by disrupting cross talk between SLP-76 and LAT .",gene
"Targeting of p300 to the interleukin-2 promoter via CREB-Rel cross-talk during mitogen and oncogenic molecular signaling in activated T-cells . In this report , we explore the mechanisms of targeting of p300 to the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter in response to mitogenic and oncogenic molecular signals . Recruitment of p300 by cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-Rel cross-talk at the composite CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) - TRE element of the IL-2 promoter is essential for promoter inducibility during T-cell activation , and CD28RE-TRE is the exclusive target of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I oncoprotein Tax . The intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity of p300 is dispensable for activation of the IL-2 promoter , and the N-terminal 743 residues contain the minimal structural requirements for synergistic transactivation of the CD28RE-TRE , the IL-2 promoter , and endogenous IL-2 gene expression . Mutational analysis of p300 reveals differential structural requirements for the N-terminal p300 module by individual cis-elements within the IL-2 promoter . These findings provide evidence that p300 assembles at the IL-2 promoter to form an enhanceosome-like signal transduction target that is centrally integrated at the CD28RE-TRE element of the IL-2 promoter through specific protein module-targeted associations in activated T-cells .",gene
"Regulation of cytokine production in T-cell responses to inhalant allergen : GATA-3 expression distinguishes between Th1- and Th2-polarized immunity . BACKGROUND : The precise nature of allergen-specific cytokine responses in atopics versus non-atopics , in particular the 'Th1 polarity ' of responses in non-atopics , remains controversial . This is due in part to the relative insensitivity of cytokine detection systems , and associated variations in kinetics of cytokine production and catabolism in in vitro culture systems . As an alternative to cytokine measurement , this study focuses on expression of the transcription factor GATA-3 for analysis of allergen-specific Th cell responses . METHODS : Cord blood mononuclear cells were Th1- or Th2-polarized by culture in IL-12- or IL-4-employing established methods ; PBMC from house dust mite ( HDM ) -sensitive atopics and controls were stimulated overnight with HDM ; cytokine production was measured by ELISA and GATA-3 mRNA expression by PCR . RESULTS : Cytokine -driven Th2 polarization of naive T cells is associated with marked upregulation of GATA-3 expression , whereas a reciprocal expression pattern accompanies differentiation towards the Th1 cytokine phenotype . In T cells from HDM skin prick test-positive ( HDM-SPT+/HDM-IgE+ ) volunteers , overnight stimulation results in marked upregulation of GATA-3 expression , compared to an equally marked downregulation of expression in T cells from SPT-/IgE- subjects . In subjects who are HDM-SPT+ but IgE- , GATA-3 expression levels remained relatively stable during culture with HDM . CONCLUSIONS : Upregulation of GATA-3 expression in PBMC is a hallmark of the early phase of Th2 recall responses to specific allergen in atopics . The reciprocal expression pattern observed in HDM-specific recall responses of non-atopics provides independent confirmation of the presence of underlying Th1-like immunity",gene

"The heat shock response reduces myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein -induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice . The stress response ( SR ) can block inflammatory gene expression by preventing activation of transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) . As inflammatory gene expression contributes to the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases , we tested the effects of the SR on the progression of the demyelinating disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) . EAE was actively induced in C57BL/6 mice using an encephalitogenic myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( MOG ( 35-55 ) ) peptide . Whole body hyperthermia was used to induce a heat shock response ( HSR ) in immunized mice 2 days after the booster MOG ( 35-55 ) peptide injection . The HSR reduced the incidence of EAE by 70 % , delayed disease onset by 6 days , and attenuated disease severity . The HSR attenuated leukocyte infiltration into CNS assessed by quantitation of perivascular infiltrates , and by reduced staining for CD4 and CD25 immunopositive T-cells . T-cell activation , assessed by the production of interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) in response to MOG ( 35-55 ) , was also decreased by the HSR . The HSR reduced inflammatory gene expression in the brain that normally occurs during EAE , including the early increase in RANTES ( regulated on activation of normal T-cell expressed and secreted ) expression , and the later expression of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase . The early activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB was also blocked by the HSR . The finding that the SR reduces inflammation in the brain and the clinical severity of EAE opens a novel therapeutic approach for prevention of autoimmune diseases .",gene
"In vivo detection of intracellular signaling pathways in developing thymocytes . Information regarding the intracellular signaling processes that occur during the development of T cells has largely been obtained with the use of transgenic mouse models , which although providing invaluable information are time consuming and costly . To this end , we have developed a novel system that facilitates the in vivo analysis of signal transduction pathways during T-lymphocyte development . This approach uses reporter-plasmids for the detection of intracellular signals mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase or cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase . Reporter-plasmids are transfected into thymocytes in fetal thymic organ culture by accelerated DNA/particle bombardment ( gene gun ) , and the activation of a signaling pathway is determined in the form of a standard luciferase assay . Importantly , this powerful technique preserves the structural integrity of the thymus , and will provide an invaluable tool to study how thymocytes respond to normal environmental stimuli encountered during differentiation within the thymic milieu . Thus , this method allows for the monitoring of signals that occur in a biological time frame , such as during differentiation , and within the natural environment of differentiating cells .",gene
"Core-binding factor beta ( CBFbeta ) , but not CBFbeta-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain , rescues definitive hematopoiesis in CBFbeta -deficient embryonic stem cells . Core-binding factor beta ( CBFbeta ) is the non-DNA-binding subunit of the heterodimeric CBFs . Genes encoding CBFbeta ( CBFB ) , and one of the DNA-binding CBFalpha subunits , Runx1 ( also known as CBFalpha2 , AML1 , and PEBP2alphaB ) , are required for normal hematopoiesis and are also frequent targets of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias in humans . Homozygous disruption of either the Runx1 or Cbfb gene in mice results in embryonic lethality at midgestation due to hemorrhaging in the central nervous system , and severely impairs fetal liver hematopoiesis . Results of this study show that Cbfb-deficient mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells can differentiate into primitive erythroid colonies in vitro , but are impaired in their ability to produce definitive erythroid and myeloid colonies , mimicking the in vivo defect . Definitive hematopoiesis is restored by ectopic expression of full-length Cbfb transgenes , as well as by a transgene encoding only the heterodimerization domain of CBFbeta . In contrast , the CBFbeta - smooth muscle myosin heavy chain ( SMMHC ) fusion protein generated by the inv ( 16 ) associated with acute myeloid leukemias ( M4Eo ) can not rescue definitive hematopoiesis by Cbfb-deficient ES cells . Sequences responsible for the inability of CBFbeta -SMMHC to rescue definitive hematopoiesis reside in the SMMHC portion of the fusion protein . Results also show that the CBFbeta-SMMHC fusion protein transdominantly inhibits definitive hematopoiesis , but not to the same extent as homozygous loss of Runx1 or Cbfb .

"The latency pattern of Epstein-Barr virus infection and viral IL-10 expression in cutaneous natural killer/T-cell lymphomas . The nasal type , extranodal natural killer or T ( NK/T ) -cell lymphoma is usually associated with latent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection . In order to elucidate the EBV gene expression patterns in vivo , we examined eight patients with cutaneous EBV-related NK/T-cell lymphomas , including six patients with a NK-cell phenotype and two patients with a T-cell phenotype . The implication of EBV in the skin lesions was determined by the presence of EBV-DNA , EBV-encoded nuclear RNA ( EBER ) and a clonality of EBV-DNA fragments containing the terminal repeats . Transcripts of EBV-encoded genes were screened by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , and confirmed by Southern blot hybridization . The expression of EBV-related antigens was examined by immunostaining using paraffin-embedded tissue sections and cell pellets of EBV-positive cell lines . Our study demonstrated that all samples from the patients contained EBV nuclear antigen ( EBNA ) -1 mRNA which was transcribed using the Q promoter , whereas both the Q promoter and another upstream promoter ( Cp/Wp ) were used in EBV-positive cell lines , B95.8 , Raji and Jiyoye . Latent membrane protein-1 ( LMP-1 ) mRNA was detected in seven of eight patients and all cell lines , whereas EBNA-2 transcripts were found only in the cell lines . Immunostaining showed no LMP-1 , EBNA-2 or ZEBRA antigens in the paraffin-embedded tissue sections , although they were positive in the cell line cells . Latent BHRF1 transcripts encoding bcl-2 homologue and BCRF1 transcripts encoding viral interleukin ( vIL ) -10 were detected in one and two of eight patients , respectively . A patient with NK-cell lymphoma expressing both transcripts died of rapid progression of the illness . Our results indicate that the restricted expression of the latency-associated EBV",gene

"Oxidized alkyl phospholipids are specific , high affinity peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligands and agonists . Synthetic high affinity peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) agonists are known , but biologic ligands are of low affinity . Oxidized low density lipoprotein ( oxLDL ) is inflammatory and signals through PPARs . We showed , by phospholipase A ( 1 ) digestion , that PPARgamma agonists in oxLDL arise from the small pool of alkyl phosphatidylcholines in LDL . We identified an abundant oxidatively fragmented alkyl phospholipid in oxLDL , hexadecyl azelaoyl phosphatidylcholine ( azPC ) , as a high affinity ligand and agonist for PPARgamma . [ ( 3 ) H ] azPC bound recombinant PPARgamma with an affinity ( K ( d ) ( ( app ) ) approximately 40 nm ) that was equivalent to rosiglitazone ( BRL49653 ) , and competition with rosiglitazone showed that binding occurred in the ligand-binding pocket . azPC induced PPRE reporter gene expression , as did rosiglitazone , with a half-maximal effect at 100 nm . Overexpression of PPARalpha or PPARgamma revealed that azPC was a specific PPARgamma agonist . The scavenger receptor CD36 is encoded by a PPRE-responsive gene , and azPC enhanced expression of CD36 in primary human monocytes . We found that anti-CD36 inhibited azPC uptake , and it inhibited PPRE reporter induction . Results with a small molecule phospholipid flippase mimetic suggest azPC acts intracellularly and that cellular azPC accumulation was efficient . Thus , certain alkyl phospholipid oxidation products in oxLDL are specific , high affinity extracellular ligands and agonists for PPARgamma that induce PPAR-responsive genes",gene
"Regulation of the human MAT2B gene encoding the regulatory beta subunit of methionine adenosyltransferase , MAT II . Methionine adenosyltransferase ( MAT ) catalyzes the biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine ( AdoMet ) , a key molecule in transmethylation reactions and polyamine biosynthesis . The MAT II isozyme consists of a catalytic alpha2 and a regulatory beta subunit . Down-regulation of the MAT II beta subunit expression causes a 6-10-fold increase in intracellular AdoMet levels . To understand the mechanism by which the beta subunit expression is regulated , we cloned the MAT2B gene , determined its organization , characterized its 5'-flanking sequences , and elucidated the in vitro and in vivo regulation of its promoter . Transcription of the MAT2B gene initiates at position -203 relative to the translation start site . Promoter deletion analysis defined a minimal promoter between positions +52 and +93 base pairs , a GC-rich region . Inclusion of the sequences between -4 and +52 enhanced promoter activity ; this was primarily because of an Sp1 recognition site at +9/+15 . The inclusion of sequences up to position -115 provided full activity ; this was attributed to a TATA at -32 . The Sp1 site at position +9 was key for the formation of protein.DNA complexes . Mutation of both the Sp1 site at +9 and the TATA at -32 reduced promoter activity to its minimal level . Supershift assays showed no effect of the anti-Sp1 antibody on complex formation , whereas the anti-Sp3 antibody had a strong effect on protein.DNA complex formation , suggesting that Sp3 is one of the main factors binding to this Sp1 site . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays supported the involvement of both Sp1 and Sp3 in complexes formed on the MAT2B promoter . The data show that the 5'-untranslated sequences play an important role in regulating the MAT2B gene and identifies the Sp1 site at +9 as a potential target for modulating MAT2B expression , a process that can have a major effect on intracellular",gene

"Molecular pathogenesis of influenza A virus infection and virus-induced regulation of cytokine gene expression . Despite vaccines and antiviral substances influenza still causes significant morbidity and mortality world wide . Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of influenza virus replication , pathogenesis and host immune responses is required for the development of more efficient means of prevention and treatment of influenza . Influenza A virus , which replicates in epithelial cells and leukocytes , regulates host cell transcriptional and translational systems and activates , as well as downregulates apoptotic pathways . Influenza A virus infection results in the production of chemotactic ( RANTES , MIP-1 alpha , MCP-1 , MCP-3 , and IP-10 ) , pro-inflammatory ( IL-1 beta , IL-6 , IL-18 , and TNF-alpha ) , and antiviral ( IFN-alpha/beta ) cytokines . Cytokine gene expression is associated with the activation of NF-kappa B , AP-1 , STAT and IRF signal transducing molecules in influenza A virus-infected cells . In addition of upregulating cytokine gene expression , influenza A virus infection activates caspase-1 enzyme , which is involved in the proteolytic processing of proIL-1 beta and proIL-18 into their biologically active forms . Influenza A virus-induced IFN-alpha/beta is essential in host 's antiviral defence by activating the expression of antiviral Mx , PKR and oligoadenylate synthetase genes . IFN-alpha/beta also prolongs T cell survival , upregulates IL-12 and IL-18 receptor gene expression and together with IL-18 stimulates NK and T cell IFN-gamma production and the development of Th1-type immune response .",gene
"Comparison of hprt and lacI mutant frequency with DNA adduct formation in N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene-treated Big Blue rats . N-Hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene ( N-OH-AAF ) is the proximate carcinogenic metabolite of the powerful rat liver carcinogen 2-acetylaminofluorene . In this study , transgenic Big Blue ( R ) rats were used to examine the relationship between in vivo mutagenicity and DNA adduct formation by N-OH-AAF in the target liver compared with that in nontarget tissues . Male rats were given one , two , or four doses of 25 mg N-OH-AAF/kg body weight by i.p. injection at 4-day intervals , and groups of treated and control rats were euthanized up to 10 weeks after beginning the dosing . Mutant frequencies were measured in the spleen lymphocyte hprt gene , and lacI mutant frequencies were determined in the liver and spleen lymphocytes . At 6 weeks after beginning the dosing , the hprt mutant frequency in spleen lymphocytes from the four-dose group was 16.5 x 10 ( -6 ) compared with 3.2 x 10 ( -6 ) in control animals . Also at 6 weeks , rats given one , two , or four doses of N-OH-AAF had lacI mutant frequencies in the liver of 97.6 , 155.6 , and 406.8 x 10 ( -6 ) , respectively , compared with a control frequency of 25.7 x 10 ( -6 ) ; rats given four doses had lacI mutant frequencies in spleen lymphocytes of 55.8 x 10 ( -6 ) compared with a control frequency of 20.4 x 10 ( -6 ) . Additional rats were evaluated for DNA adduct formation in the liver , spleen lymphocytes , and bone marrow by ( 32 ) P-postlabeling .

"Expression of Mad1 in T cells leads to reduced thymic cellularity and impaired mitogen-induced proliferation .

To investigate more closely any effects of Mad1 expression on thymocytes , we examined thymic selection using MHC class I-restricted H-Y-TCR transgenic mice . Mad1 expression in vivo reduces the efficiency of positive selection . Furthermore , thymocytes and splenic T cells from lck-Mad1 transgenic mice display a profound proliferative defect in response to activation with either PMA/Ionomycin or immobilized anti-CD3/CD28 antibody . This proliferative defect is not reversed by addition of exogenous IL-2 and is p53-independent . The growth inhibition caused by Mad1 is overcome by expression of active c-Myc .",gene
"Differential requirement for the transcription factor PU.1 in the generation of natural killer cells versus B and T cells . PU.1 is a member of the Ets family of transcription factors required for the development of various lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages , but its role in natural killer ( NK ) cell development is not known . The study shows that PU.1 is expressed in NK cells and that , on cell transfer into alymphoid Rag2/gammac ( -/- ) mice , hematopoietic progenitors of PU.1 ( -/- ) fetal liver cells could generate functional NK cells but not B or T cells . Nevertheless , the numbers of bone marrow NK cell precursors and splenic mature NK cells were reduced compared to controls . Moreover , PU.1 ( -/- ) NK cells displayed reduced expression of the receptors for stem cell factor and interleukin ( IL ) -7 , suggesting a nonredundant role for PU.1 in regulating the expression of these cytokine receptor genes during NK cell development . PU.1 ( -/- ) NK cells also showed defective expression of inhibitory and activating members of the Ly49 family and failed to proliferate in response to IL-2 and IL-12 . Thus , despite the less stringent requirement for PU.1 in NK cell development compared to B and T cells , PU.1 regulates NK cell differentiation and homeostasis .",gene
"Benzene-extracted components are important for the major activity of diesel exhaust particles : effect on interleukin-8 gene expression in human bronchial epithelial cells . Epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that diesel exhaust particles ( DEPs ) may be related to increasing respiratory mortality and morbidity . We have shown that DEPs augmented the production of inflammatory cytokines by human airway epithelial cells in vitro . To better understand the mechanisms of their proinflammatory activities , we studied the effects of several components extracted from DEPs on interleukin ( IL ) -8 expression in human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B and normal human airway epithelial cells obtained from very peripheral airways by an ultrathin bronchoscope . We used several agents active on signal transduction pathways in cytokine expression , such as the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporin , antioxidant agents including N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC ) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) inhibitor SB203580 . Benzene-extracted components showed effects mimicking DEPs on IL-8 gene expression , release of several cytokines ( IL-8 ; granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ; and regulated on activation , normal T cells expressed and secreted ) and nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B activation . We also found that NAC , PDTC , and SB203580 suppressed the activities of DEPs and their benzene extracts , suggesting the roles of oxidants-mediated NF-kappa B activation and p38MAPK pathways . Finally , benzo [ a ] pyrene , one of the important compounds included in the benzene component , replicated the activities shown by DEPs .",gene
"The nuclear receptor PPAR gamma is expressed by mouse T lymphocytes and PPAR gamma agonists induce apoptosis . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) -gamma is a nuclear hormone receptor that serves as a trans factor to regulate lipid metabolism . Intense interest is focused on PPAR-gamma and its ligands owing to its putative role in adipocyte differentiation . Little is known , however , about the functions of PPAR-gamma in the immune system , especially in T lymphocytes . We demonstrate that both naive and activated ovalbumin-specific T cells from DO11.10-transgenic mice express PPAR-gamma mRNA and protein . In order to determine the function of PPAR-gamma , T cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin or antigen and antigen-presenting cells . Simultaneous exposure to PPAR-gamma ligands ( e.g. 15-deoxy-Delta ( 12 , 14 ) -prostaglandin J ( 2 ) , troglitazone ) showed drastic inhibition of proliferation and significant decreases in cell viability . The decrease in cell viability was due to apoptosis of the T lymphocytes , and occurred only when cells were treated with PPAR-gamma , and not PPAR-alpha agonists , revealing specificity of this response for PPAR-gamma . These observations suggest that PPAR-gamma agonists play an important role in regulating T cell-mediated immune responses by inducing apoptosis . T cell death via PPAR-gamma ligation may act as a potent anti-inflammatory signal in the immune system , and ligands could possibly be used to control disorders in which excessive inflammation occurs .",gene
"Suppression of lung inflammation in rats by prevention of NF-kappaB activation in the liver . Activation of NF-kappaB and production of NF-kappaB -dependent chemokines are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of neutrophilic lung inflammation . Calpain-1 inhibitor ( CI-1 ) blocks activation of NF-kappaB by preventing proteolysis of the inhibitory protein IkappaB-alpha by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway . We hypothesized that inhibition of proteasome function with CI-1 would block NF-kappaB activation in vivo after intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , and that NF-kappaB inhibition would be associated with suppression of chemokine gene expression and attenuation of neutrophilic alveolitis . We treated rats with a single i.p. injection of CI-1 ( 10 mg/kg ) two hours prior to i.p. LPS ( 7 mg/kg ) . Treatment with Cl-1 prevented degradation of IkappaB-alpha and activation of NF-kappaB in the liver in response to LPS ; however , Cl-1 treatment had no detected effect on NF-kappaB activation in lung tissue . CI-1 treatment prior to LPS resulted in 40 % lower MIP-2 concentration in lung lavage fluid compared to rats treated with vehicle prior to LPS ( 502 +/- 112 pg/ml vs. 859 +/-144 pg/ml , P < 0.05 ) . In addition , CI-1 treatment substantially inhibited LPS-induced neutrophilic alveolitis ( 2.7+ /- 1.2 x 10 ( 5 ) vs. 43.7 +/- 12.2 x 10 ( 5 ) lung lavage neutrophils , P < 0.01 ) . These data indicate that NF-kappaB inhibition in the liver can alter lung inflammation induced by systemic LPS treatment and suggest that a liver-lung interaction contributes to the inflammatory response of the lung .",gene
Notch1 regulates maturation of CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes by modulating TCR signal strength . Notch signaling regulates cell fate decisions in multiple lineages . We demonstrate in this report that retroviral expression of activated Notch1 in mouse thymocytes abrogates differentiation of immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes into both CD4 and CD8 mature single-positive T cells . The ability of Notch1 to inhibit T cell development was observed in vitro and in vivo with both normal and TCR transgenic thymocytes . Notch1 -mediated developmental arrest was dose dependent and was associated with impaired thymocyte responses to TCR stimulation . Notch1 also inhibited TCR-mediated signaling in Jurkat T cells . These data indicate that constitutively active Notch1 abrogates CD4+ and CD8+ maturation by interfering with TCR signal strength and provide an explanation for the physiological regulation of Notch expression during thymocyte development .,gene

"Autostimulation of the Epstein-Barr virus BRLF1 promoter is mediated through consensus Sp1 and Sp3 binding sites . As an essential step in the lytic cascade , the Rta homologues of gammaherpesviruses all activate their own expression . Consistent with this biologic function , the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) Rta protein powerfully stimulates the promoter of its own gene , Rp , in EBV-positive B cells in transient-transfection reporter-based assays . We analyzed the activity of RpCAT in response to Rta by deletional and site-directed mutagenesis . Two cognate Sp1 binding sites located at -279 and -45 relative to the transcriptional start site proved crucial for Rta-mediated activation . Previously described binding sites for the cellular transcription factor Zif268 and the viral transactivator ZEBRA were found to be dispensable for activation of RpCAT by Rta . Gel shift analysis , using extracts of B cells in latency or induced into the lytic cycle , identified Sp1 and Sp3 as the predominant cellular proteins bound to Rp near -45 . During the lytic cycle , ZEBRA bound Rp near the Sp1/Sp3 site . The binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to Rp correlated with the reporter activities in the mutagenesis study , establishing a direct link between transcriptional activation of Rp by Rta and DNA binding by Sp1 and/or Sp3 . The relative abundance or functional state of the cellular Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors may be altered in response to stimuli that induce the BRLF1 promoter and thereby contribute to the activation of the viral lytic cycle .",gene
"Gene transfer of antisense hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha enhances the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy . Solid tumors meet their demands for nascent blood vessels and increased glycolysis , to combat hypoxia , by activating multiple genes involved in angiogenesis and glucose metabolism . Hypoxia inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) is a constitutively expressed basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor , formed by the assembly of HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta ( Arnt ) , that is stablized in response to hypoxia , and rapidly degraded under normoxic conditions . It activates the transcription of genes important for maintaining oxygen homeostasis . Here , we demonstrate that engineered down-regulation of HIF-1alpha by intratumoral gene transfer of an antisense HIF-1alpha plasmid leads to the down-regulation of VEGF , and decreased tumor microvessel density . Antisense HIF-1alpha monotherapy resulted in the complete and permanent rejection of small ( 0.1 cm in diameter ) EL-4 tumors , which is unusual for an anti-angiogenic agent where transient suppression of tumor growth is the norm . It induced NK cell -dependent rejection of tumors , but failed to stimulate systemic T cell -mediated anti-tumor immunity , and synergized with B7-1-mediated immunotherapy to cause the NK cell and CD8 T cell -dependent rejection of larger EL-4 tumors ( 0.4 cm in diameter ) that were refractory to monotherapies . Mice cured of their tumors by combination therapy resisted a rechallenge with parental tumor cells , indicating systemic antitumor immunity had been achieved . In summary , whilst intensive investigations are in progress to target the many HIF-1 effectors , the results herein indicate that blocking hypoxia-inducible pathways and enhancing NK-mediated antitumor immunity by targeting HIF-1 itself may be advantageous , especially when combined with cancer immunotherapy .",gene
"Runx2 : a novel oncogenic effector revealed by in vivo complementation and retroviral tagging . The Runx2 ( Cbfa1 , Pebp2alphaA , Aml3 ) gene was previously identified as a frequent target for transcriptional activation by proviral insertion in T-cell lymphomas of CD2-MYC transgenic mice . We have recently shown that over-expression of the full-length , most highly expressed Runx2 isoform in the thymus perturbs T-cell development , leads to development of spontaneous lymphomas at low frequency and is strongly synergistic with Myc . To gain further insight into the relationship of Runx2 to other lymphomagenic pathways , we tested the effect of combining the CD2-Runx2 transgene either with a Pim1 transgene ( E ( mu ) -Pim1 ) or with the p53 O genotype , as each of these displays independent synergy with Myc . In both cases we observed synergistic tumour development . However , Runx2 appeared to have a dominant effect on the tumour phenotype in each case , with most tumours conforming to the CD3 ( + ) , CD8 ( + ) , CD4 ( +/- ) phenotype seen in CD2-Runx2 mice . Neonatal infection of CD2-Runx2 mice with Moloney murine leukaemia virus ( Moloney MLV ) also led to a dramatic acceleration of tumour onset . Analysis of known Moloney MLV target genes in these lymphomas showed a high frequency of rearrangement at c-Myc or N-Myc ( 82 % ) , and a significant number at Pim1 or Pim2 ( 23 % ) , and at Pal1/Gfi1 ( 18 % ) . These results indicate that Runx2 makes a distinct contribution to T-cell lymphoma development which does not coincide with any of the oncogene complementation groups previously identified by retroviral tagging .",gene
"The involvement of TNF-alpha -related apoptosis-inducing ligand in the enhanced cytotoxicity of IFN-beta -stimulated human dendritic cells to tumor cells . TNF-alpha -related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) is characterized by its preferential induction of apoptosis of tumor cells but not normal cells . Dendritic cells ( DCs ) , besides their role as APCs , now have been demonstrated to exert cytotoxicity or cytostasis on some tumor cells . Here , we report that both human CD34 ( + ) stem cell -derived DCs ( CD34DCs ) and human CD14 ( + ) monocyte -derived DCs ( MoDCs ) express TRAIL and exhibit cytotoxicity to some types of tumor cells partially through TRAIL . Moderate expression of TRAIL appeared on CD34DCs from the 8th day of culture and was also seen on freshly isolated monocytes . The level of TRAIL expression remained constant until DC maturation . TRAIL expression on immature CD34DCs or MoDCs was greatly up-regulated after IFN-beta stimulation . Moreover , IFN-beta could strikingly enhance the ability of CD34DCs or MoDCs to kill TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells , but LPS did not have such an effect . The up-regulation of TRAIL on IFN-beta -stimulated DCs partially contributed to the increased cytotoxicity of DCS : Pretreatment of TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells with caspase-3 inhibitor could significantly increase their resistance to the cytotoxicity of IFN-beta -stimulated DCS : In contrast , NF-kappaB inhibitor could significantly increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to the killing by nonstimulated or LPS-stimulated DCS : Our studies demonstrate that IFN-beta -stimulated DCs are functionally cytotoxic . Thus , an innate mechanism of DC-mediated antitumor immunity might exist in vivo in which DCs act as effectors to directly kill tumor cells partially via TRAIL . Subsequently , DCs act as APCs involved in the uptake , processing , and presentation of apoptotic tumor Ags to cross-prime CD8 ( + ) CTL cells .",gene
"Tumor cells regulate the lytic activity of tumor-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes by modulating the inhibitory natural killer receptor function . Tumor-infiltrating p58+ T cells from a renal tumor were specifically expanded in response to tumor cell stimulation and cloned . These p58+ T cells were found to express a memory phenotype and corresponded to clonal TCRBV3 T-cell expansion . Functionally , p58 ( + ) CTLs displayed a low lytic activity for HLA-A2 tumor and normal cells . However , this lytic activity was significantly increased after blockade of p58 with specific monoclonal antibodies . Interestingly , we demonstrated that stimulation by tumor cells was required to trigger the inhibitory effect of p58 on the lytic activity of antigen-specific CTLs and that stimulation of the inhibitory function of p58 by tumor cells correlated with an inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB activation in p58+ tumor-specific CTLS .",gene
"T-cell factor-1 expression during human natural killer cell development and in circulating CD56 ( + ) bright natural killer cells . Transcription factors are essential to govern differentiation along the lymphoid lineage from uncommitted hematopoietic stem cells . Although many of these transcription factors have putative roles based on murine knockout experiments , their function in human lymphoid development is less known and was studied further . Transcription factor expression in fresh and cultured adult human bone marrow and umbilical cord blood progenitors was evaluated . We found that fresh CD34 ( + ) Lin ( - ) cells that are human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -DR ( - ) or CD38 ( - ) constitutively express GATA-3 but not T-cell factor-1 ( TCF-1 ) or Id-3 . Culture with the murine fetal liver cell line AFT024 and defined cytokines was capable of inducing TCF-1 mRNA . However , no T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was identified in cultured progeny . Id-3 , a basic helix loop helix factor with dominant negative function for T-cell differentiation transcription factors , also was upregulated and may explain unsuccessful T-cell maturation . To better understand the developmental link between natural killer ( NK ) cells derived from progenitors , we studied NK cell subsets circulating in blood . CD56 ( +bright ) , but not CD56 ( +dim ) , NK cells constitutively express TCF-1 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis . The TCF-1 isoform found in CD56 ( +bright ) cells , which express lectin but not immunoglobulin class I recognizing inhibitory receptors , was identical to that induced in NK cell differentiation culture and was distinctly different from isoforms in T cells . These results suggest that TCF-1 does not target human killer immunoglobulin receptor genes , TCF-1 is uniquely expressed in circulating CD56 ( +bright ) NK cells , and specific TCF-1 isoforms may play an important role in regulating NK differentiation from a common NK/T-cell progenitor .",gene
"Transcriptional activation by a matrix associating region-binding protein . contextual requirements for the function of bright . Bright ( B cell regulator of IgH transcription ) is a B cell -specific , matrix associating region-binding protein that transactivates gene expression from the IgH intronic enhancer ( E mu ) . We show here that Bright has multiple contextual requirements to function as a transcriptional activator . Bright can not transactivate via out of context , concatenated binding sites . Transactivation is maximal on integrated substrates . Two of the three previously identified binding sites in E mu are required for full Bright transactivation . The Bright DNA binding domain defined a new family , which includes SWI1 , a component of the SWI.SNF complex shown to have high mobility group-like DNA binding characteristics . Similar to one group of high mobility group box proteins , Bright distorts E mu binding site -containing DNA on binding , supporting the concept that it mediates E mu remodeling . Transfection studies further implicate Bright in facilitating spatially separated promoter-enhancer interactions in both transient and stable assays . Finally , we show that overexpression of Bright leads to enhanced DNase I sensitivity of the endogenous E mu matrix associating regions . These data further suggest that Bright may contribute to increased gene expression by remodeling the immunoglobulin locus during B cell development .",gene
"Analysis of BCL-6 mutations in classic Hodgkin disease of the B- and T-cell type . BCL-6 is essential for germinal center formation and thus for affinity maturation of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) genes by somatic mutations . The 5'-noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene is even a target for the mutation machinery . Translocations of the BCL-6 gene to heterologous promoters and mutations of its 5'-noncoding regulatory region were reported to be potential mechanisms for deregulating BCL-6 expression and for playing a role in the genesis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma . In line with this hypothesis is the observation that B-cell lymphoma with somatic mutations , such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma , also carry BCL-6 mutations , some of which are recurrently detectable . Classic Hodgkin disease ( cHD ) is also derived from B cells with high loads of somatic mutations and thus a further candidate for BCL-6 mutations . To determine the presence and potential role of BCL-6 mutations in cHD , the 5'-noncoding BCL-6 proportion of single Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg ( HRS ) cells from 6 cases of cHD and 6 cases of HD-derived cell lines was analyzed . All B-cell-derived HD cases and cell lines harbored BCL-6 mutations . In contrast , both T-cell-derived HD cases and cell lines were devoid of BCL-6 mutations . With only one exception , there were no lymphoma-specific recurrent BCL-6 mutations detected , and BCL-6 protein was absent from the HRS cells of most cases . In conclusion , ( 1 ) somatic BCL-6 mutations are restricted to cHD cases of B-cell origin , and ( 2 ) the BCL-6 mutations represent mostly irrelevant somatic base substitutions without consequences for BCL-6 protein expression and the pathogenesis of cHD .",gene
"Gadd45gamma is dispensable for normal mouse development and T-cell proliferation . Gadd45gamma , a family member of the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene family 45 ( Gadd45 ) , is strongly induced by interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) in peripheral T cells . While in most tissues all Gadd45 family members are expressed , Gadd45gamma is the only member that is induced by IL-2 . Here we show that the IL-2 -induced expression of Gadd45gamma is dependent on a signaling pathway mediated by the tyrosine kinase Jak3 and the transcription factors Stat5a and Stat5b ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) . Previous studies with ectopically overexpressed Gadd45gamma in various cell lines implicated its function in negative growth control . To analyze the physiological role of Gadd45gamma we used homologous recombination to generate mice lacking Gadd45gamma . Gadd45gamma -deficient mice develop normally , are indistinguishable from their littermates , and are fertile . Furthermore , hematopoiesis in mice lacking Gadd45gamma is not impaired and Gadd45gamma -deficient T lymphocytes show normal responses to IL-2 . These data demonstrate that Gadd45gamma is not essential for normal mouse development and hematopoiesis , possibly due to functional redundancy among the Gadd45 family members . Gadd45gamma is also dispensable for IL-2 -induced T-cell proliferation .",gene

We observed that the mRNA levels of myc family genes , c-myc and max , were markedly reduced in MG thymuses . These results indicate that c-myc -mediated signaling is abnormal in MG thymuses .

"Immunohistochemical detection of interferon-gamma-producing cells in dermatophytosis . Skin lesions of dermatophytosis are thought to be a result of a T cell -dependent inflammatory response that is mediated by various cytokines . We examined whether IFN-gamma-positive cells ( as expression of Th1 response ) were present in the skin lesions of dermatophytosis in situ by immunohistochemical techniques . Mixtures of CD4-positive T cells and CD8-positive T cells were found to be present in the dermal infiltrates of the lesions . Considerable numbers of CD1a-positive cells were detected in the upper dermis and epidermis . A marked accumulation of CD68-positive cells was found in the upper dermis . IFN-gamma-positive cells were present in the upper dermis of the lesions . The pattern of IFN-gamma staining appeared to be intracellular in mononuclear lymphoid cells . The staining was considered to be highly specific because it could be completely blocked by preabsorption with recombinant IFN-gamma . Our data support the hypothesis that the skin lesions of dermatophytosis may be associated with a Th1 response . Th1 response , which is characterized by IFN-gamma release , is thought to be involved in the host defense against dermatophytes and to reflect cutaneous reaction in dermatophytosis .",gene
"Regulation of the helix-loop-helix proteins , E2A and Id3 , by the Ras - ERK MAPK cascade . Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathways leads to cellular differentiation and/or proliferation in a wide variety of cell types , including developing thymocytes . The basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) proteins E12 and E47 and an inhibitor HLH protein , Id3 , play key roles in thymocyte differentiation . We show here that E2A DNA binding is lowered in primary immature thymocytes consequent to T cell receptor ( TCR ) -mediated ligation . Whereas expression of E2A mRNA and protein are unaltered , Id3 transcripts are rapidly induced upon signaling from the TCR . Activation of Id3 transcription is regulated in a dose-dependent manner by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) MAPK module . These observations directly connect the ERK MAPK cascade and HLH proteins in a linear pathway .",gene
"Retinoic acid up-regulates myeloid ICAM-3 expression and function in a cell-specific fashion -- evidence for retinoid signaling pathways in the mast cell lineage . Investigation of mast cell responsiveness toward retinoic acid ( RA ) revealed selective promotion of ICAM-3 expression in the human mast cell line HMC-1 . This process was dose- and time-dependent and detectable by flow cytometry , Western blot analysis , ELISA , and Northern blot analysis . ICAM-3 modulation was found to be cell-type dependent , detectable also for HL-60 cells and monocytes but not U-937 and only weakly for KU812 cells . Terminally differentiated skin mast cells also failed to up-modulate their ICAM-3 , suggesting the requirement for some degree of immaturity for the process . RA-mediated effects on ICAM-1 expression , studied in parallel , were clearly distinct from those on ICAM-3 . Investigation of retinoid receptor expression , known to mediate intracellular RA signaling , revealed presence of RAR alpha , RAR gamma , RXR beta , and RXR gamma transcripts in all cell lines studied , and HMC-1 cells were the only line lacking RXR alpha . RAR beta , not expressed at baseline , was induced by RA in a fashion obviously correlating with ICAM-3 up-regulation . Increased ICAM-3 expression was of functional significance , such that processes stimulated or co-stimulated via ICAM-3 ( homotypic aggregation , IL-8 secretion ) were clearly enhanced upon RA pretreatment , suggesting that RA may contribute via hitherto unrecognized pathways to immune function and host defense .",gene
"CD28 and T cell co-stimulation . Over the last decade the concept of T cell co-stimulation has emerged to take a central role in the process of T cell activation . However , the exact definition of co-stimulation is still unclear . In this review , we re-examine the concept of co-stimulation . We suggest that while co-stimulation is important , there is little evidence to link co-stimulation with T cell anergy . We then suggest a framework for studying co-stimulation . Focusing on recent advances in our understanding of CD28 , we discuss four areas of T cell activation where co-stimulation may play a role .",gene
"Regulation of activator protein-1 and NF-kappa B in CD8+ T cells exposed to peripheral self-antigens . The transcriptional events that control T cell tolerance to peripheral self Ags are still unknown . In this study , we analyzed the regulation of AP-1 - and NF-kappa B -mediated transcription during in vivo induction of tolerance to a self Ag expressed exclusively on hepatocytes . Naive CD8 ( + ) Desire ( Des ) ( + ) T cells isolated from the Des TCR-transgenic mice that are specific for the H-2K ( b ) class I Ag were transferred into Alb-K ( b ) -transgenic mice that express the H-2K ( b ) Ag on hepatocytes only . Tolerance develops in these mice . We found that the self-reactive CD8 ( + ) Des ( + ) T cells were transiently activated , then became unresponsive and were further deleted . In contrast to CD8 ( + ) Des ( + ) T cells activated in vivo with APCs , which express high AP-1 and high NF-kappa B transcriptional activity , the unresponsive CD8 ( + ) Des ( + ) T cells expressed no AP-1 and only weak NF-kappa B transcriptional activity . The differences in NF-kappa B transcriptional activity correlated with the generation of distinct NF-kappa B complexes . Indeed , in vivo primed T cells predominantly express p50/p50 and p65/p50 dimers , whereas these p50-containing complexes are barely detectable in tolerant T cells that express p65- and c-Rel-containing complexes . These observations suggest that fine regulation of NF-kappa B complex formation may determine T cell fate .",gene

"Existence of retinoic acid-receptor -independent retinoid X-receptor -dependent pathway in myeloid cell function . We previously reported that ER-27191 ( 4- [ 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10-hexahydro-7 , 7 , 10 , 10-tetramethyl-1- ( 3-pyridylmethyl ) anthra [ 1 , 2-b ] pyrrol-3-yl ] benzoic acid ) is a potent antagonist of retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) , and ER-35795 ( ( 2E , 4E , 6E ) -7- [ 1- ( 1-methylethyl ) -8-chloro-1 , 2 , 3 , 4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl ] -6-fluoro-3-methyl-2 , 4 , 6-nonatrienoic acid ) is a novel retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) -specific agonist . By using these compounds , we investigated whether distinct RAR -dependent and RXR -dependent pathways operate to mediate the diverse activities of retinoids , particularly , the effects of the RXR pathway on cellular function . ER-27191 completely antagonized HL60 cell differentiation induced by all-trans-retinoic acid ( atRA ) . However , the differentiation induced by the ER-35795 was not antagonized at all by the RAR antagonist , but was inhibited by an RXR homodimer antagonist ( LGD100754 , ( 2E , 4E , 6Z ) -7- ( 3-n-propoxy-5 , 6 , 7 , 8-tetrahydro-5 , 5 , 8 , 8-tetramethylnaphthalen-2-yl ) -3-methylocta-2 , 4 , 6-trienoic acid ) . Its agonistic action on RXR/RAR heterodimer , on the other hand , was neutralized by the RAR antagonist . During HL60 cell differentiation , atRA induced RARbeta mRNA , while the RXR had no effect .

"Targeting Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase ( SHP-1 ) into lipid rafts inhibits CD3 -induced T cell activation . To study the mechanism by which protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPs ) regulate CD3 -induced tyrosine phosphorylation , we investigated the distribution of PTPs in subdomains of plasma membrane . We report here that the bulk PTP activity associated with T cell membrane is present outside the lipid rafts , as determined by sucrose density gradient sedimentation . In Jurkat T cells , approximately 5 -- 10 % of Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase ( SHP-1 ) is constitutively associated with plasma membrane , and nearly 50 % of SHP-2 is translocated to plasma membrane after vanadate treatment . Similar to transmembrane PTP , CD45 , the membrane-associated populations of SHP-1 and SHP-2 are essentially excluded from lipid rafts , where other signaling molecules such as Lck , linker for activation of T cells , and CD3 zeta are enriched . We further demonstrated that CD3 -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these substrates is largely restricted to lipid rafts , unless PTPs are inhibited . It suggests that a restricted partition of PTPs among membrane subdomains may regulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation in T cell membrane . To test this hypothesis , we targeted SHP-1 into lipid rafts by using the N-terminal region of Lck ( residues 1 -- 14 ) . The results indicate that the expression of Lck/SHP-1 chimera inside lipid rafts profoundly inhibits CD3 -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3 zeta/epsilon , IL-2 generation , and nuclear mobilization of NF-AT . Collectively , these results suggest that the exclusion of PTPs from lipid rafts may be a mechanism that potentiates TCR / CD3 activation",gene
"An instructive component in T helper cell type 2 ( Th2 ) development mediated by GATA-3 . Although interleukin ( IL ) -12 and IL-4 polarize naive CD4 ( + ) T cells toward T helper cell type 1 ( Th1 ) or Th2 phenotypes , it is not known whether cytokines instruct the developmental fate in uncommitted progenitors or select for outgrowth of cells that have stochastically committed to a particular fate . To distinguish these instructive and selective models , we used surface affinity matrix technology to isolate committed progenitors based on cytokine secretion phenotype and developed retroviral-based tagging approaches to directly monitor individual progenitor fate decisions at the clonal and population levels . We observe IL-4 -dependent redirection of phenotype in cells that have already committed to a non-IL-4-producing fate , inconsistent with predictions of the selective model . Further , retroviral tagging of naive progenitors with the Th2-specific transcription factor GATA-3 provided direct evidence for instructive differentiation , and no evidence for the selective outgrowth of cells committed to either the Th1 or Th2 fate . These data would seem to exclude selection as an exclusive mechanism in Th1 / Th2 differentiation , and support an instructive model of cytokine-driven transcriptional programming of cell fate decisions .",gene
"In vitro-activated human lupus T cells express normal estrogen receptor proteins which bind to the estrogen response element . We have shown that estrogen receptor ( ERalpha , ERbeta ) transcripts are expressed in SLE and normal T cells . In this study , T cell nuclear extracts from female lupus patients and normal donors were tested for biologically active ER proteins capable of binding to the human estrogen response element ( hERE ) by electrophoretic mobility shift assays . When peripheral blood T cells were stimulated with 17beta-estradiol ( E2 ) , PMA and ionomycin , two major retarded bands in T cell nuclear extracts exhibited a migration pattern similar to slow migrating protein-ERE complexes in human breast cancer cell extracts . T cells cultured only with E2 did not have these complexes . The formation of the complexes was inhibited by competition with the hERE cold oligonucleotide and partially with anti-ERalpha antibodies . There was no notable difference in the migration pattern of ERE-binding proteins between the SLE and normal T cell extracts . Together , these results suggest that activated human T cells , whether lupus-derived or normal-derived , contain biologically active ERalpha proteins . Other factors may be responsible for differential sensitivity of lupus T cells to estrogen .",gene
"Mechanism of the inhibitory effect of protease inhibitor on tumor necrosis factor alpha production of monocytes . If the inflammatory response becomes excessive or uncontrolled by some stimuli , inappropriate inflammatory responses occur . Monocytes are extremely important cells for regulating the cytokine network and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) and interleukin- ( IL ) 10 , which are mainly synthesized by monocytes , are representative cytokines that play a central role in the cytokine network . Protease inhibitors such as gabexate mesilate ( GM ) and ulinastatin ( UTI ) have been shown to have various beneficial effects by inhibiting the activation of leukocytes , but the mechanism for this has yet to be fully elucidated . In this study we investigated the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of protease inhibitors on the proinflammatory cytokine production of lipopolysaccharide- ( LPS ) stimulated monocytes . LPS-stimulated monocytes were treated with GM or UTI . The value of TNFalpha and IL-10 in the culture medium of monocytes was measured and each mRNA expression was assayed . The inhibitory effect of protease inhibitors on the activity of intracellular signal transduction pathways such as protein kinase C ( PKC ) and nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) were also evaluated . GM decreased the TNFalpha production of LPS-stimulated monocytes as shown by the inhibition of mRNA expression and increased the IL-10 production of LPS-stimulated monocytes . GM also suppressed the NFkappaB activity of LPS-stimulated monocytes . UTI decreased the TNFalpha production of LPS-stimulated monocytes , but did not inhibit the TNFalpha mRNA expression . The present study shows that the inhibitory effect of GM on the TNFalpha production of activated human monocytes is mediated by the suppression of NFkappaB activation , while the mechanism of UTI inhibiting TNFalpha production of human monocytes may be due to the inhibition of either the translation or secretion of TNFalpha .",gene
"Homocysteine stimulates the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in endothelial cells leading to enhanced monocyte chemotaxis . Hyperhomocysteinemia has been identified as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis . The infiltration of monocytes into the arterial wall is one of the key events during atherogenesis . Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) is a potent chemokine that stimulates the migration of monocytes into the intima of the arterial wall . The mechanism by which increased monocyte infiltration occurs in atherosclerotic lesions in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia has not been delineated . The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of homocysteine on MCP-1 production in endothelial cells . Cells were incubated with homocysteine . The secretion of MCP-1 protein was significantly increased ( 195 % as compared to the control ) in cells treated with pathological concentrations of homocysteine . Such effect was accompanied by an increased expression of MCP-1 mRNA ( 176 % as compared to the control ) in endothelial cells which resulted in enhanced monocyte chemotaxis . The p38 MAP kinase as well as other members of the p38 MAP kinase pathway , including MKK3 , MKK6 , ATF-2 and Elk-1 , were activated in homocysteine-treated cells . Homocysteine-induced MCP-1 expression and subsequent monocyte chemotaxis were blocked by a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor ( SB203580 ) suggesting that the p38 MAP kinase pathway might be involved in homocysteine-induced MCP-1 expression in endothelial cells . In contrast , staurosporine , a protein kinase C inhibitor , had no effect on homocysteine-induced MCP-1 expression . In conclusion , our results indicate that homocysteine stimulates MCP-1 expression in endothelial cells leading to enhanced monocyte chemotaxis .",gene
"Inducible resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis in B cells . Apoptosis produced in B cells through Fas ( APO-1 , CD95 ) triggering is regulated by signals derived from other surface receptors : CD40 engagement produces upregulation of Fas expression and marked susceptibility to Fas -induced cell death , whereas antigen receptor engagement , or IL-4R engagement , inhibits Fas killing and in so doing induces a state of Fas -resistance , even in otherwise sensitive , CD40 -stimulated targets . Surface immunoglobulin and IL-4R utilize at least partially distinct pathways to produce Fas -resistance that differentially depend on PKC and STAT6 , respectively . Further , surface immunoglobulin signaling for inducible Fas -resistance bypasses Btk , requires NF-kappaB , and entails new macromolecular synthesis . Terminal effectors of B cell Fas -resistance include the known anti-apoptotic gene products , Bcl-xL and FLIP , and a novel anti-apoptotic gene that encodes FAIM ( Fas Apoptosis Inhibitory Molecule ) . faim was identified by differential display and exists in two alternatively spliced forms ; faim-S is broadly expressed , but faim-L expression is tissue-specific . The FAIM sequence is highly evolu- tionarily conserved , suggesting an important role for this molecule throughout phylogeny . Inducible resistance to Fas killing is hypothesized to protect foreign antigen-specific B cells during potentially hazardous interactions with FasL-bearing T cells , whereas autoreactive B cells fail to become Fas -resistant and are deleted via Fas -dependent cytotoxicity . Inadvertent or aberrant acquisition of Fas -resistance may permit autoreactive B cells to escape Fas deletion , and malignant lymphocytes to impede anti-tumor immunity .",gene
"Stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha -induced chemotaxis in T cells is mediated by nitric oxide signaling pathways . Stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha ( SDF1 alpha ) and its cognate chemokine receptor CXCR4 act as potent chemoattractants and regulate trafficking and homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells and lymphocytes . However , the molecular mechanisms regulating SDF1 alpha -driven cell migration are not well defined . In this study , we have explored the roles of the second messenger NO and the transcription factor NF-kappa B in SDF1 alpha -induced T cell migration . SDF1 alpha treatment of Jurkat T cells increased the activity of NO synthase , which catalyzes the generation of NO . We observed that pretreatment of Jurkat cells or activated PBLs with several NO donors significantly enhanced the SDF1 alpha -induced migration , whereas various inhibitors of NO synthase markedly abrogated the chemotactic response in a concentration-dependent manner . Furthermore , we observed that inhibitors of the transcription factor NF-kappa B , which is linked to NO signaling pathways , also significantly blocked the SDF1 alpha -induced chemotactic response . However , these compounds did not have a significant effect on SDF1 alpha -induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activity . In addition , the MAP/Erk kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 did not abrogate SDF1 alpha -induced chemotaxis . AKT , which has been shown to mediate NO production , was also phosphorylated upon SDF1 alpha stimulation . These studies suggest that NO-related signaling pathways may mediate SDF1 alpha -induced chemotaxis , but not mitogen-activated protein kinase activation .",gene
"The lack of NF-kappa B transactivation and PKC epsilon expression in CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) thymocytes correlates with negative selection . Deletion of autoreactive thymocytes at the DP stage is the basis for tolerance to thymus-expressed self antigens . In this study we investigated whether distinct signalling pathways are induced in DP thymocytes as compared to mature T cells upon stimulation with antigen . Using triple transgenic mice expressing a TCR transgene , dominant negative ras/Mek proteins and a reporter gene construct with AP-1 or NF-kappa B binding sites , we showed a complete lack of transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B but not AP-1 in DP thymocytes , whereas both were transcriptionally active in mature T cells after antigenic stimulation . Lack of NF-kappa B induction correlated with increased death in response to antigen . AP-1 induction was dependent on the integrity of the ras/Mek pathway indicating that this pathway was activated in the DP thymocytes . In contrast , we found a complete lack of constitutive expression of the epsilon isoform of Protein Kinase C ( PKC ) in DP thymocytes , although it was present in mature thymocytes and peripheral T cells . Taken together the results suggest that the lack of PKC epsilon in DP thymocytes could lead to the absence of NF-kappa B activity after antigenic stimulation contributing to negative selection .

"CD2 stimulation leads to the delayed and prolonged activation of STAT1 in T cells but not NK cells . OBJECTIVE : T lymphocytes can be activated by soluble factors such as cytokines or through direct cell-cell interactions . Although cytokine receptors are known to signal through STAT family transcription factors , the mechanisms by which other cell-surface molecules , such as CD2 , transduce signals is unclear . The goal of this study was to determine whether stimulation of T cells through CD2 recapitulates aspects of cytokine -induced T-cell activation by use of STAT transcription factors . MATERIALS AND METHODS : T cells were treated with anti-CD2 antibodies or cells bearing the natural CD2 ligand CD58 , after which signaling through STAT transcription factors was assessed . RESULTS : Stimulation of CD2 on primary T lymphocytes leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation , nuclear translocation , and DNA binding of STAT1 . In contrast to stimulation by cytokines , the activation of STAT1 in response to CD2 ligation is delayed and does not involve Jak kinases . Furthermore , while STAT phosphorylation induced by cytokines is generally transient , STAT1 phosphorylation following CD2 stimulation persists for a period of days . Transcription of key target genes such as IRF1 and c-fos proceeds with delayed kinetics following CD2 stimulation , suggesting that this unique pattern of STAT activation may lead to a distinct cellular response following CD2 ligation . This pathway appears to be restricted to T cells , as stimulation of CD2 on NK cells does not lead to STAT1 activation . CONCLUSION : Stimulation of T cells through cell-surface molecules such as CD2 involves activation of STAT transcription factors , thus recapitulating elements of cytokine signaling .",gene
"NFATc1 and NFATc2 together control both T and B cell activation and differentiation . NFAT transcription factors play critical roles in gene transcription during immune responses . To investigate further the two most prominent NFAT family members , NFATc1 and NFATc2 , we generated mice bearing lymphoid systems devoid of both . Doubly deficient T cells displayed cell surface markers of activation yet were significantly deficient in the development of multiple effector functions , including Th cytokine production , surface effector molecule expression , and cytolytic activity . Nevertheless , doubly deficient B cells were hyperactivated , as evidenced by extremely elevated serum IgG1 and IgE , as well as plasma cell expansion and infiltration of end organs . Thus , in T cells , NFATc1 and NFATc2 are dispensable for inflammatory reactivity but are required for effector differentiation , while in B cells , NFATs regulate both normal homeostasis and differentiation .",gene
"Epstein-barr virus immediate-early protein BZLF1 is SUMO-1 modified and disrupts promyelocytic leukemia bodies . Although the immediate-early proteins of both herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) and cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) are known to modify promyelocytic leukemia ( PML ) ( ND10 ) bodies in the nucleus of the host cell , it has been unclear whether lytic infection with gamma herpesviruses induces a similar effect . The PML protein is induced by interferon , involved in major histocompatibility complex class I presentation , and necessary for certain types of apoptosis . Therefore , it is likely that PML bodies function in an antiviral capacity . SUMO-1 modification of PML is known to be required for the formation of PML bodies . To examine whether Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) lytic replication interferes with PML bodies , we expressed the EBV immediate-early genes BZLF1 ( Z ) and BRLF1 ( R ) in EBV-positive cell lines and examined PML localization . Both Z and R expression resulted in PML dispersion in EBV-positive cells . Z but not R expression is sufficient to disrupt PML bodies in EBV-negative cell lines . We show that dispersion of PML bodies by Z requires a portion of the transcriptional activation domain of Z but not the DNA-binding function . As was previously reported for the HSV-1 ICP0 and CMV IE1 proteins , Z reduces the amount of SUMO-1-modified PML . We also found that Z itself is SUMO-1 modified ( through amino acid 12 ) and that Z competes with PML for limiting amounts of SUMO-1 . These results suggest that disruption of PML bodies is important for efficient lytic replication of EBV . Furthermore , Z may potentially alter the function of a variety of cellular proteins by inhibiting SUMO-1 modification",gene
"Suppression of nuclear factor-kappaB and stimulation of inhibitor kappaB by troglitazone : evidence for an anti-inflammatory effect and a potential antiatherosclerotic effect in the obese . To elucidate whether troglitazone exerts an antiinflammatory effect in humans , in vivo , we investigated the suppression of nuclear factor kappaB ( NFkappaB ) in mononuclear cells ( MNC ) by this drug . We measured intranuclear NFkappaB , total cellular NFkappaB , inhibitor kappaB ( IkappaB ) alpha , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation , and p47 ( phox ) subunit ( a key component protein of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase ) in MNC . Plasma tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha , soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( sICAM-1 ) , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( PAI-1 ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , and interleukin ( IL ) -10 ( antiinflammatory cytokine ) concentrations were also measured as mediators of inflammatory activity that are regulated by the proinflammatory transcription factor NFkappaB . Seven nondiabetic obese patients were given 400 mg troglitazone daily for 4 weeks . Blood samples were collected before and at weekly intervals thereafter . MNC were separated ; and the levels of intranuclear NFkappaB , total cellular NFkappaB , IkappaBalpha , and p47 ( phox ) subunit and ROS generation were determined . Plasma was used to measure insulin glucose , TNFalpha , sICAM , MCP-1 , PAI-1 , CRP , and IL-10 . Plasma insulin concentrations fell significantly at week 1 , from 31.2 +/- 29.1 to 14.2 +/- 11.4 mU/L ( P < 0.01 ) and remained low throughout 4 weeks . Plasma glucose concentrations did not alter significantly . There was a fall in intranuclear NFkappaB ,",gene
"total cellular NFkappaB , and p47 ( phox ) subunit , with an increase in cellular IkappaBalpha at week 2 , which persisted until week 4 . There was a parallel fall in ROS generation by MNC at week 1 ; this progressed and persisted until week 4 ( P < 0.001 ) . Plasma TNF-alpha , sICAM-1 , MCP-1 , and PAI-1 concentrations fell significantly at week 4 . Plasma IL-10 concentration increased significantly , whereas plasma CRP concentrations decreased . We conclude that troglitazone has an antiinflammatory action that may contribute to its putative antiatherosclerotic effects .",gene
"Tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent activation of NF-kappa B . Requirement for p56 LCK and ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinases . Phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of I kappa B inhibitory subunits induces activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B . Although serine phosphorylation has been shown to induce ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of I kappa B-alpha , little is known about the mechanisms that lead to release of active NF-kappa B in T cells as a consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation of I kappa B-alpha [ Imbert , V. , Rupec , R.A. , Livolsi , A. , Pahl , H.L. , Traenckner , B.M. , Mueller-Dieckmann , C. , Farahifar , D. , Rossi , B. , Auberger , P. , Baeuerle , P. & Peyron , J.F. ( 1996 ) Cell 86 , 787 -- 798 ] . The involvement of the tyrosine kinases p56 ( lck ) and ZAP-70 in this reaction is demonstrated here using specific pharmacological inhibitors and Jurkat mutants unable to express these kinases . Although the inhibitors prevented both pervanadate-induced phosphorylation of I kappa B-alpha on Tyr42 and NF-kappa B activation , we observed that , in p56 ( lck ) -deficient Jurkat mutants , NF-kappa B could still associate with I kappa B-alpha despite phosphorylation on Tyr42 . Furthermore , the SH2 domain of p56 ( lck ) appeared to be required for pervanadate-induced NF-kappa B activation but not for Tyr42 phosphorylation . These results show that p56 ( lck ) and ZAP-70 are key components of the signaling pathway that leads to phosphotyrosine-dependent NF-kappa B activation in T cells and confirm that tyrosine kinases must control at least two different steps to induce activation of NF-kappa B . Finally , we show that H ( 2 ) O",gene

"Specific missense mutations in NEMO result in hyper-IgM syndrome with hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia . The gene that encodes nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) essential modulator ( or NEMO , also known as IKKgamma ) is required for activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB . We describe mutations in the putative zinc-finger domain of NEMO that result in an X-linked primary immunodeficiency characterized by hyper-IgM syndrome and hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia ( XHM-ED ) . These mutations prevent CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) -mediated degradation of inhibitor of NF-kappaB alpha ( IkappaB-alpha ) and account for the following observations : B cells from XHM-ED patients are unable to undergo immunoglobulin class-switch recombination and antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) are unable to synthesize the NF-kappaB-regulated cytokines interleukin 12 ( IL-12 ) or tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) when stimulated with CD40L . Nevertheless , innate immunity is preserved in XHM-ED patients because APCs retain the capacity to respond to stimulation by lipopolysaccharide or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 's antigen ( SAC ) . Overall , the phenotype observed in XHM-ED patients shows that the putative zinc-finger domain of NEMO has a regulatory function and demonstrates the definite requirement of CD40 -mediated NF-kappaB activation for B cell immunoglobulin class-switching .",gene
"Granulocytic differentiation of human NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells induced by all-trans retinoic acid metabolites . The metabolism of all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) has been reported to be partly responsible for the in vivo resistance to ATRA seen in the treatment of human acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . However , ATRA metabolism appears to be involved in the growth inhibition of several cancer cell lines in vitro . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of the principal metabolites of ATRA [ 4-hydroxy-retinoic acid ( 4-OH-RA ) , 18-hydroxy-retinoic acid ( 18-OH-RA ) , 4-oxo-retinoic acid ( 4-oxo-RA ) , and 5 , 6-epoxy-retinoic acid ( 5 , 6-epoxy-RA ) ] in NB4 , a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line that exhibits the APL diagnostic t ( 15 ; 17 ) chromosomal translocation and expresses the PML-RAR alpha fusion protein . We established that the four ATRA metabolites were indeed formed by the NB4 cells in vitro . NB4 cell growth was inhibited ( 69-78 % at 120 h ) and cell cycle progression in the G1 phase ( 82-85 % at 120 h ) was blocked by ATRA and all of the metabolites at 1 microM concentration . ATRA and its metabolites could induce NB4 cells differentiation with similar activity , as evaluated by cell morphology , by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test ( 82-88 % at 120 h ) or by the expression of the maturation specific cell surface marker CD11c . In addition , nuclear body reorganization to macropunctated structures , as well as the degradation of PML-RAR alpha , was found to be similar for ATRA and all of its metabolites . Comparison of the relative potency of the retinoids using the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test showed effective concentrations required to differentiate 50 % of cells in 72 h as follows : ATRA , 15.8 +/- 1.7 nM ; 4-oxo-RA , 38.3",gene
"+/- 1.3 nM ; 18-OH-RA , 55.5 +/- 1.8 nM ; 4-OH-RA , 79.8 +/- 1.8 nM ; and 5 , 6-epoxy-RA , 99.5 +/- 1.5 nM . The ATRA metabolites were found to exert their differentiation effects via the RAR alpha nuclear receptors , because the RAR alpha-specific antagonist BMS614 blocked metabolite-induced CD11c expression in NB4 cells . These data demonstrate that the principal ATRA Phase 1 metabolites can elicit leukemia cell growth inhibition and differentiation in vitro through the RAR alpha signaling pathway , and they suggest that these metabolites may play a role in ATRA antileukemic activity in vivo .",gene
"Expression of oestrogen and progesterone receptors by mast cells alone , but not lymphocytes , macrophages or other immune cells in human upper airways . BACKGROUND : Nasal polyposis often coexists with asthma in airway inflammatory conditions characterised by the infiltration of a range of immune cells . A potentially important role for ovarian hormones has been implicated in airway inflammation but the cellular target for such action is not known . METHODS : Expression of oestrogen receptors ( ER ) and progesterone receptors ( PR ) was examined using immunohistochemistry in formalin fixed nasal polyp tissues from 47 subjects . The cells positive for ER or PR were confirmed by spatial location , dual immunolabelling , and histochemical staining . RESULTS : Consistent with the known features of nasal polyps , CD4+ ( T helper/inducer ) , CD8+ ( cytotoxic/suppressor ) , CD68+ ( macrophages ) , mast cells , eosinophils and neutrophils were all clearly detected by their relevant monoclonal antibodies or appropriate histochemical staining , but only mast cells tested positive for ER /PR labelling with their polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies . The frequencies for expression were 61.7 % for ER positive and 59.6 % for PR positive cells . The expression of ER / PR was independent of patient sex and age but was highly correlated with the numbers of mast cells ( r = 0.973 , p < 0.001 for ER ; r = 0.955 , p < 0.001 for PR ) . Fewer than 5 % of mast cells were found to be negative for ER / PR expression . CONCLUSIONS : Mast cells alone , but not lymphocytes , macrophages , or other immune cells , express ER / PR in human upper airways . Numerous ER/PR positive mast cells exist in nasal polyps , indicating that this may be a major route for the involvement of sex hormones in airway inflammation when exposed to the higher and varying concentration of oestrogen and progesterone characteristic of females .",gene
"NF kappa b signaling in posthypoxic endothelial cells : relevance to E-selectin expression and neutrophil adhesion . Our previous studies have implicated the nuclear transcription factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) in the regulation of adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells exposed to anoxia-reoxygenation ( A/R ) or a redox imbalance . The objectives of this study were ( 1 ) to define the kinetics of NF kappa B activation by examining I kappa B alpha degradation and the nuclear translocation of p65 in response to A/R or redox imbalance ( induced by treatment of cells with diamide and buthionine sulfoximine ) and ( 2 ) to determine whether the signal for I kappa B alpha degradation , nuclear translocation of p65 , and E-selectin -mediated neutrophil adhesion is related to the activity of protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) , protein tyrosine phosphatase ( PTPase ) and/or protein kinase C ( PKC ) . The results demonstrate that both A/R and redox imbalance led to I kappa B alpha degradation within 30 min and the concomitant appearance of p65 in the nucleus , consistent with rapid cytosolic activation of NF kappa B and subsequent nuclear translocation of the activated p65 subunit . Inhibition of PKC blocked I kappa B alpha degradation and p65 translocation in A/R-challenged , but not redox-altered , endothelial cells . However , both A/R- and redox-induced NF kappa B activation was blocked by inhibition of PTK . Similarly , A/R-induced E-selectin expression and neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion were blocked by inhibition of PKC or PTK , while only PTK inhibited the redox-induced adhesion response . Pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine effectively blocked A/R- or redox-induced I kappa B degradation and significantly attenuated the respective neutrophil adhesion responses . Collectively , these findings indicate that A/R-induced E-selectin expression and neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion are mediated by both PKC and PTK",gene

"Induction of apoptosis in human lymphocytes by the herbicide 2 , 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid . Dimethylammonium salt of 2 , 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( DMA-2 , 4-D ) is a widely used herbicide that is considered moderately toxic . In the present study we found that DMA-2 , 4-D is able to cause apoptosis in peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy individuals and Jurkat T cells . Apoptosis induced by DMA-2 , 4-D was dose and time dependent , independent of Fas , TNF receptor 1 or the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor , and involved disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and activation of caspase-9 . ZVAD-FMK , a broad-spectrum inhibitor of caspases , blocked DMA-2 , 4-D-induced apoptosis completely . While an inhibitor of caspase-9 , as well as caspase-9 and caspase-3 inhibitors in combination , strongly blocked DMA-2 , 4-D-induced apoptosis , an inhibitor of caspase-3 had a moderate inhibitory effect . Unlike Fas -mediated apoptosis , the initiator caspase , caspase-8 , was not involved in DMA-2 , 4-D-induced apoptosis . Transfection of Jurkat cells with Bcl-2 prevented DMA-2 , 4-D-induced disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and led to a complete blockage of apoptosis . Our data indicate that DMA-2 , 4-D kills human lymphocytes by initiating apoptosis via a direct effect on mitochondria . The activation of caspases occurs downstream of mitochondrial damage , and the dysfunction of mitochondria appears to be sufficient for triggering all downstream events leading to apoptosis .",gene
"Inhibition of Th1 differentiation by IL-6 is mediated by SOCS1 . Interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) is a cytokine produced by immune and nonimmune cells and exhibits functional pleiotropy and redundancy . IL-6 plays an important role in the differentiation of several cell types . Here , we describe a novel function of IL-6 : the negative regulation of CD4 + Th1 cell differentiation . While IL-6 -directed CD4 + Th2 differentiation is mediated by IL-4 , inhibition of Th1 differentiation by IL-6 is independent of IL-4 . IL-6 upregulates suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 ( SOCS1 ) expression in activated CD4+ T cells , thereby interfering with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 ( STAT1 ) phosphorylation induced by interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) . Inhibition of IFNgamma receptor-mediated signals by IL-6 prevents autoregulation of IFNgamma gene expression by IFNgamma during CD4+ T cell activation , thereby preventing Th1 differentiation . Thus , IL-6 promotes CD4 + Th2 differentiation and inhibits Th1 differentiation by two independent molecular mechanisms .",gene
"Interaction between CCAAT/enhancer binding protein and cyclic AMP response element binding protein 1 regulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcription in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage . Recent observations have shown two CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ( C/EBP ) binding sites to be critically important for efficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication within cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage , a cell type likely involved in transport of the virus to the brain . Additionally , sequence variation at C/EBP site I , which lies immediately upstream of the distal nuclear factor kappa B site and immediately downstream of a binding site for activating transcription factor ( ATF ) / cyclic AMP response element binding protein ( CREB ) , has been shown to affect HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) activity . Given that C/EBP proteins have been shown to interact with many other transcription factors including members of the ATF/CREB family , we proceeded to determine whether an adjacent ATF/CREB binding site could affect C/EBP protein binding to C/EBP site I . Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses indicated that selected ATF/CREB site variants assisted in the recruitment of C/EBP proteins to an adjacent , naturally occurring , low-affinity C/EBP site . This biophysical interaction appears to occur via at least two mechanisms . First , low amounts of CREB-1 and C/EBP appear to heterodimerize and bind to a site consisting of a half site from both the ATF/CREB and C/EBP binding sites . In addition , CREB-1 homodimers bind to the ATF/CREB site and recruit C/EBP dimers to their cognate weak binding sites . This interaction is reciprocal , since C/EBP dimer binding to a strong C/EBP site leads to enhanced CREB-1 recruitment to ATF/CREB sites that are weakly bound by CREB . Sequence variation at both C/EBP and ATF/CREB sites affects the molecular interactions involved in mediating both of these mechanisms . Most importantly , sequence variation at the ATF/CREB binding site affected basal LTR activity as",gene

"Selective inhibition of interleukin-4 gene expression in human T cells by aspirin . Previous studies indicated that aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid [ ASA ] ) can have profound immunomodulatory effects by regulating cytokine gene expression in several types of cells . This study is the first in which concentrations of ASA in the therapeutic range were found to significantly reduce interleukin ( IL ) -4 secretion and RNA expression in freshly isolated and mitogen-primed human CD4+ T cells . In contrast , ASA did not affect IL-13 , interferon-gamma , and IL-2 expression . ASA inhibited IL-4 , but not IL-2 , promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in transiently transfected Jurkat T cells . The structurally unrelated nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin and flurbiprofen did not affect cytokine gene expression in T cells , whereas the weak cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor salicylic acid was at least as effective as ASA in inhibiting IL-4 expression and promoter activity . The inhibitory effect of ASA on IL-4 transcription was not mediated by decreased nuclear expression of the known salicylate target nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB and was accompanied by reduced binding of an inducible factor to an IL-4 promoter region upstream of , but not overlapping , the NF of activated T cells- and NF-kappaB-binding P1 element . It is concluded that anti-inflammatory salicylates , by means of a previously unrecognized mechanism of action , can influence the nature of adaptive immune responses by selectively inhibiting the expression of IL-4 , a critical effector of these responses , in CD4+ T cells .",gene
"Molecular and cellular mediators of interleukin-1 -dependent acute inflammatory arthritis . OBJECTIVE : To examine the molecular and cellular mechanisms in a model of acute inflammatory monarticular arthritis induced by methylated bovine serum albumin ( mBSA ) and interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) . METHODS : Mice were injected intraarticularly with mBSA on day 0 and subcutaneously with recombinant human IL-1beta on days 0-2 . At day 7 , knee joints were removed and assessed histologically . Flow cytometry and RNase protection were used to analyze IL-1 -dependent events . RESULTS : C57BL/6 ( B6 ) , 129/Sv , and ( B6 x 129/ Sv ) F1 hybrid mice , all H-2b strains , were susceptible to mBSA /IL-1-induced arthritis , whereas C3H/HeJ ( H-2k ) mice were not . B6 mice lacking T and B cells ( RAG1-/- ) or major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II antigens ( MHCII-/- ) , and B6 mice treated with a CD4+ T cell-depleting monoclonal antibody , were resistant to disease . In contrast , B cell-deficient ( muMT/ muMT ) mice developed arthritis at an incidence and severity similar to that of controls . RelB-deficient ( RelB-/- ) bone marrow chimeric mice had arthritis that was significantly reduced in incidence and severity . In B6 mice , flow cytometry demonstrated an IL-1-dependent leukocyte infiltration into the synovial compartment and RNase protection assays revealed induction of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) for the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 , macrophage inhibitory protein 2 ( MIP-2 ) , RANTES , MIP-1alpha , and MIP-1beta , in vivo and in vitro .

"Positive and negative regulation of granulopoiesis by endogenous RARalpha . Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is always associated with chromosomal translocations that disrupt the retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RARalpha ) gene . Whether these translocations relate to a role for endogenous RARalpha in normal granulopoiesis remains uncertain because most studies addressing this question have used non-physiological overexpression systems . Granulocyte differentiation in cells derived from RARalpha-deficient ( RARalpha ( -/- ) ) mice was studied and evaluated in the context of agonist-bound and ligand-free RARalpha . Our results demonstrate that RARalpha is dispensable for granulopoiesis , as RARalpha ( -/- ) mice have a normal granulocyte population despite an impaired ability to respond to retinoids . However , although it is not absolutely required , RARalpha can bidirectionally modulate granulopoiesis . RARalpha stimulates differentiation in response to exogenous retinoic acid . Furthermore , endogenous retinoids control granulopoiesis in vivo , as either vitamin A-deficient mice or animals treated with an RAR antagonist accumulate more immature granulocytes in their bone marrow . Conversely , RARalpha acts to limit differentiation in the absence of ligand because granulocyte precursors from RARalpha ( -/- ) mice differentiate earlier in culture . Thus , the block in granulopoiesis exerted by RARalpha fusion proteins expressed in APL cells may correspond to an amplification of a normal function of unliganded RARalpha .",gene
"Expression and function of a stem cell promoter for the murine CBFalpha2 gene : distinct roles and regulation in natural killer and T cell development . The Runt family transcription factor CBFalpha2 ( AML1 , PEBP2alphaB , or Runx1 ) is required by hematopoietic stem cells and expressed at high levels in T-lineage cells . In human T cells CBFalpha2 is usually transcribed from a different promoter ( distal promoter ) than in myeloid cells ( proximal promoter ) , but the developmental and functional significance of this promoter switch has not been known . Here , we report that both coding and noncoding sequences of the distal 5 ' end are highly conserved between the human and the murine genes , and the distal promoter is responsible for the overwhelming majority of CBFalpha2 expression in murine hematopoietic stem cells as well as in T cells . Distal promoter activity is maintained throughout T cell development and at lower levels in B cell development , but downregulated in natural killer cell development . The distal N-terminal isoform binds to functionally important regulatory sites from known target genes with two- to threefold higher affinity than the proximal N-terminal isoform . Neither full-length isoform alters growth of a myeloid cell line under nondifferentiating conditions , but the proximal isoform selectively delays mitotic arrest of the cell line under differentiating conditions , resulting in the generation of greater numbers of neutrophils .",gene
"Constitutive PI3-K activity is essential for proliferation , but not survival , of Theileria parva-transformed B cells . Theileria is an intracellular parasite that causes lymphoproliferative disorders in cattle , and infection of leucocytes induces a transformed phenotype similar to tumour cells , but the mechanisms by which the parasite induces this phenotype are not understood . Here , we show that infected B lymphocytes display constitutive phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3-K ) activity , which appears to be necessary for proliferation , but not survival . Importantly , we demonstrate that one mechanism by which PI3-K mediates the proliferation of infected B lymphocytes is through the induction of a granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) -dependent autocrine loop . PI3-K induction of GM-CSF appears to be at the transcriptional level and , consistently , we demonstrate that PI3-K is also involved in the constitutive induction of AP-1 and NF-kappaB , which characterizes Theileria-infected leucocytes .

"Lymphokine dependence of STAT3 activation produced by surface immunoglobulin cross-linking and by phorbol ester plus calcium ionophore treatment in B cells . Stimulation of B cells by surface immunoglobulin ( sIg ) triggering , or through the mitogenic combination of phorbol ester and calcium ionophore , is accompanied by activation of STAT transcription factors . The mechanism responsible for the delayed nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated STAT3 was examined in detail , focusing on the role of B cell-derived lymphokines . sIg -induced activation of STAT3 was partially inhibited in B cells obtained from IL-6- or IL-10-deficient mice , and was partially blocked by neutralizing antibodies directed against either of these lymphokines . sIg -induced STAT3 activation was completely inhibited by combining IL-6- and IL-10-specific neutralizing antibodies , or by adding individual neutralizing antibodies to B cells obtained from lymphokine-deficient animals . In contrast , IL-10 alone appeared to account for STAT3 activation resulting from B cell stimulation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore . In keeping with these results , soluble IL-6 and IL-10 were found in supernatant fluid obtained from stimulated B cells . This work indicates that a lymphokine pathway is responsible for STAT3 activation that occurs late after B cell stimulation , and points out differences in B cell activation that result from stimulation through the antigen receptor and through pharmacological mimicry of signaling mediators .",gene
"Transcription factor AP-4 is a ligand for immunoglobulin-kappa promoter E-box elements . Immunoglobulin ( Ig ) -kappa promoters from humans and mice share conserved sequences . The octamer element is common to all Ig promoters and pivotal for their function . However , other conserved sequence motifs , that differ between Ig variable gene families , are required for normal promoter function . These conserved motifs do not stimulate transcription in the absence of an octamer . One example is an E-box of the E47/E12 type ( 5'-CAGCTG-3 ' ) , which is found in all promoters of the human and murine Ig-kappa gene subgroups/families , with the exception of subgroups II and VI and their related murine families . In the present study we show that the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor AP-4 , and not E47 , interacts specifically with the kappa promoter E-boxes when tested in electrophoretic mobility-shift assays using nuclear extracts derived from human and murine B-cell lines . Furthermore , AP-4 , unlike E47 , did not act as a transactivator , which is in agreement with previous studies on intact kappa promoters , showing that transcription is absent when the octamer element has been mutated . Based on these data , and the conservation of the 5'-CAGCTG-3 ' motif among human and murine kappa promoters , we propose that AP-4 is the major ligand for Ig-kappa promoter E-boxes .",gene
"A 16-mer peptide ( RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK ) from antennapedia preferentially targets the Class I pathway . Translocation of antigenic peptides into the cytosol of antigen presenting cells facilitates proteosomal processing and loading into Class I molecules for MHC presentation on the cell surface .

We now demonstrate that a 16 amino acid peptide from antennapedia can facilitate the cytoplasmic uptake of CTL epitope 9-mer peptides . Synthetic peptides were made containing the 16-mer antennapedia peptide linked in tandem to the ovalbumin SIINFEKL CTL peptide . The peptide complex was shown to rapidly internalise into APCs by confocal microscopy . This peptide induced CTL in C57BL/6 mice and protected them against growth of an ovalbumin expressing tumour cell line ( E.G7-OVA ) . The ability of the hybrid peptide to be processed and presented by APCs was similar , whether the SIINFEKL sequence was appended at the C-terminus or N-terminus of the Antennapedia peptide .

"Bone marrow cells promote TH2 polarization and inhibit virus-specific CTL generation . This laboratory recently reported that human bone marrow cells ( BMC ) inhibit the generation of virus-specific CTL in culture . The culture supernatants contained increased levels of prostaglandin E ( 2 ) ( PGE ( 2 ) ) ( shown to favor TH2 cell development ) and also inhibited EBV-CTL effector cell development . In this study , we obtained PBL from Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) IgG antibody positive kidney transplant recipients ( R ) and their living-related donors ( LRD ) one year after renal transplantation . EBV-specific CTL were then generated in vitro by stimulating PBL with autologous EBV-transformed B cells ( EBV-B ) in the presence or absence of autologous BMC . The addition of BMC to the EBV-CTL generation cultures increased the intracellular expression in CD3+ cells of IL-4 , -5 , -6 , -10 , and -13 . These CD3+ cells also expressed increased levels of the TH2 associated receptor CCR3 . Inhibition was even observed by preparing EBV-CTL generating cultures in trans-wells that separated the autologous BMC from the PBL + EBV-B . It was then observed that CD3+ cells obtained after 7 days of culture in the presence of autologous BMC could be used as inhibitors of EBV-CTL generation . Protein Kinase A ( PKA ) , a cAMP kinase that is involved in the upregulation of TH2 cytokine activity , was increased in EBV-CTL cultures by the presence of BMC . Additionally , IL-4-mediated signal transduction and activation of transcription ( STAT-6 ) phosphorylation was slightly increased . These results show that the BMC inhibition is mediated by soluble factors ( cytokines ) and that cell-cell contact in this autologous system is not required , so that BMC ( at least partially , via cytokine production ) promote TH2 polarization in culture .

"Reduction in DNA binding activity of the transcription factor Pax-5a in B lymphocytes of aged mice . Aging has been associated with intrinsic changes of the humoral immune response , which may lead to an increased occurrence of autoimmune disorders and pathogenic susceptibility . The transcription factor Pax-5 is a key regulator of B cell development . Pax-5a/B cell-specific activator protein and an alternatively spliced isoform , Pax-5d , may have opposing functions in transcriptional regulation due to the lack of a transactivation domain in Pax-5d . To study B cell -specific changes that occur during the aging process , we investigated expression patterns of Pax-5a and 5d in mature B cells of young and aged mice . RNase protection assays showed a similar transcriptional pattern for both age groups that indicates that aging has no affect on transcription initiation or alternative splicing for either isoform . In contrast , a significant reduction in the DNA binding activity of Pax-5a but not Pax-5d protein was observed in aged B cells in vitro , while Western blot analyses showed that similar levels of Pax-5a and 5d proteins were present in both age groups . The observed decrease in Pax-5a binding activity correlated with changes in expression of two Pax-5 target genes in aged B cells . Expression of the Ig J chain and the secreted form of Ig mu , which are both known to be suppressed by Pax-5a in mature B cells , were increased in B cells of aged mice . Together , our studies suggest that changes associated with the aging phenotype cause posttranslational modification ( s ) of Pax-5a but not Pax-5d , which may lead to an abnormal B cell phenotype in aged mice , associated with elevated levels of J chain , and secretion of IgM",gene
"NF-kappa B/Rel participation in the lymphokine-dependent proliferation of T lymphoid cells . Proliferative responses of lymphoid cells to IL-2 and IL-4 depend on activation of the cells , but the mechanism ( s ) by which activation enhances cellular competence to respond to cytokines is not fully understood . The NF-kappaB/Rel family represents one signal transduction pathway induced during such activation . We show in this study that inhibition of NF-kappaB through the expression of an IkappaBalpha ( inhibitory protein that dissociates from NF-kappaB ) mutant refractory to signal-induced degradation ( IkappaBalpha ( DeltaN ) ) interfered with the acquisition of competence to proliferate in response to IL-4 as well as IL-2 . Thymocytes and T cells from IkappaBalpha ( DeltaN ) transgenic mice expressed normal levels of IL-2R subunits . However , transgenic cells exhibited a dramatic defect in Stat5A activation treatment with IL-2 , and a similar defect was observed for IL-4 -induced Stat5 . In contrast , T lymphoid cells with inhibition of NF-kappaB showed normal insulin receptor substrate-2 phosphorylation and only a modest decrease in Stat6 activation and insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation after IL-4 stimulation . These results indicate that the NF-kappaB/Rel/IkappaBalpha system can regulate cytokine receptor capacitation through effects on the induction of downstream signaling by the Stat transcription factor family .",gene

Significant overt signs of toxicity and deaths occurred at 240 mg/kg , whereas body-weight and food-consumption decreases occurred at 60 and 240 mg/kg . When BMS-189453 was administered to male rats at daily doses ranging from 12.5 to 100 mg/kg for 1 week , only minimal testicular changes occurred at all doses , shortly after the dosing period . However , after a 1-month drug-free observation period , marked testicular atrophy was evident at all doses . BMS-189453 was then administered at doses of 2 , 10 , or 50 mg/kg to male rats for 1 , 3 , or 7 consecutive days . Dose- and duration-dependent testicular toxicity that occurred after a 1-month observation period did not recover , and , in some cases , was more severe 4 months after the last dose . In rabbits administered BMS-189453 at oral doses of 2 , 10 , or 50 mg/kg for 1 week , testicular degeneration and atrophy were evident in the high-dose group at 1 month following treatment . These studies indicate that retinoid antagonists can selectively produce progressive and prolonged testicular toxicity after single or repeated oral doses that are otherwise well tolerated .",gene
"Sequential involvement of NFAT and Egr transcription factors in FasL regulation . The critical function of NFAT proteins in maintaining lymphoid homeostasis was revealed in mice lacking both NFATp and NFAT4 ( DKO ) . DKO mice exhibit increased lymphoproliferation , decreased activation-induced cell death , and impaired induction of FasL . The transcription factors Egr2 and Egr3 are potent activators of FasL expression . Here we find that Egr2 and Egr3 are NFAT target genes . Activation of FasL occurs via the NFAT -dependent induction of Egr3 , as demonstrated by the ability of exogenously provided NFATp to restore Egr -dependent FasL promoter activity in DKO lymph node cells . Further , Egr3 expression is enriched in Th1 cells , suggesting a molecular basis for the known preferential expression of FasL in the Th1 versus Th2 subset .",gene
"Mechanisms and clinical relevance of nongenomic glucocorticoid actions . Glucocorticoids have profound anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions when used therapeutically . The therapeutic dose is quite variable and depends on the disease , but ranges from very low to extremely high . The rationale for the use of various dosage regimens for specific clinical indications is the existence of three distinct , therapeutically relevant effects : genomic , specific nongenomic and unspecific nongenomic . Genomic effects are mediated by cytosolic receptors that alter expression of specific genes . Specific nongenomic effects occur within a few minutes and are mediated by steroid-selective membrane receptors . Unspecific nongenomic effects occur within seconds , but only at high glucocorticoid dosages , and seem to result from direct interactions with biological membranes . For unspecific nongenomic effects , methylprednisolone and other glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit cation cycling across the plasma membrane , but to have little effect on protein synthesis . Thus , glucocorticoids could diminish or prevent the acute immune response by interfering with processes such as the rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration . It is proposed that the additional therapeutic benefit of higher doses is obtained via these nongenomic effects .",gene
"High glucose-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) expression through an osmotic effect in rat mesangial cells is PKC-NF-kappa B-dependent . AIMS/HYPOTHESIS : Infiltration of mononuclear cells and glomerular enlargement accompanied by glomerular cell proliferation are very early characteristics of the pathophysiology of diabetes . To clarify the mechanism of early diabetic nephropathy , we measured [ 3H ] -thymidine incorporation and cell numbers to show the influence of a high ambient glucose concentration and the osmotic effect on rat mesangial cell proliferation . We also measured the effect of high glucose on the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1 by flow cytometry and semiquantitative RT-PCR in mesangial cells and the adhesion of leukocytes to mesangial cells . METHODS/RESULTS : Cells exposed to high D-glucose ( 30 mmol/l ) caused an increase in [ 3H ] -thymidine incorporation and cell numbers at 24 and 48 h and normalized at 72 h ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas these changes were not found in high mannitol ( 30 mmol/l ) , IL-1 beta , or TNF alpha -stimulated mesangial cells . Cells exposed to high-glucose ( 15 , 30 , or 60 mmol/l ) or osmotic agents ( L-glucose , raffinose and mannitol ) showed that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression began to increase after 24 h , reached its maximum at 24 and 48 h and gradually decreased afterwards . The stimulatory effects of high glucose and high mannitol on mRNA expression were observed as early as 6 h and reached its maximum at 12 h . Up-regulation of ICAM-1 protein and mRNA was also found in IL-1-beta and TNF-alpha -stimulated mesangial cells . Neither vascular adhesion molecule-1 protein nor mRNA expression was , however , affected by high glucose and high mannitol . Notably , the protein kinase C inhibitors calphostin C and staurosporine reduced high glucose- or high mannitol-induced intercellular",gene
"adhesion molecule-1 mRNA expression and high glucose-induced proliferation . Furthermore , the NF-kappa B inhibitor N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone reduced high glucose- or high mannitol-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 mRNA expression and high glucose-induced proliferation . Results showed that high glucose ( 15 , 30 mmol/l ) or high concentrations of osmotic agents remarkably increased the number of adherent leukocytes to mesangial cells ( p < 0.01 ) compared with control cells ( 5 mmol/l D-glucose ) . Functional blocking of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on mesangial cells with rat intercellular adhesion molecule-1 monoclonal antibody , calphostin C , staurosporine , or N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone significantly inhibited high glucose- or high mannitol-induced increase in leukocyte adhesion ( p < < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION : These results suggest that high glucose can upregulate intercellular adhesion molecule-1 protein and mRNA expression but not vascular adhesion molecule-1 expression in mesangial cells and promote leukocyte adhesion through up-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 through osmotic effect , possibly depending on the protein kinase C nuclear factor-kappa B ( PKC - NF-kappa B ) pathway . High glucose itself can also promote mesangial cell proliferation through the PKC-NF-kappa B pathways . We conclude that hyperglycaemia in itself seems to be an important factor in the development of early diabetic nephropathy .",gene
"Combined corticosteroid/ granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) therapy in the treatment of severe congenital neutropenia unresponsive to G-CSF : Activated glucocorticoid receptors synergize with G-CSF signals . More than 90 % of patients with severe congenital neutropenia ( SCN ) respond to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) therapy . The basis for the refractory state in the remaining patients is unknown . To address this issue , we studied a child with SCN who was totally unresponsive to G-CSF and had a novel point mutation in the extracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor ( GCSF-R ) . Marrow stromal support of granulopoiesis was evaluated by plating CD34 ( + ) cells on preformed stromal layers . Nonadherent cells were harvested and assayed in clonogenic assays for granulocytic colony production . The in vitro effect of G-CSF and corticosteroids on granulopoiesis was evaluated in clonogenic assays of marrow mononuclear cells , by proliferation studies of the murine myeloid cell line 32D expressing the patient 's mutated G-CSFR , and by measuring STAT5 activation in nuclear extracts from stimulated cells . Patient 's stroma supported granulopoiesis derived from control marrow CD34 ( + ) cells in a normal manner . Normal stroma , however , failed to induce granulopoiesis from patient 's CD34 ( + ) cells . Clonogenic assays of the patient 's marrow mononuclear cells incorporating either G-CSF or hydrocortisone produced little neutrophil growth . In contrast , inclusion of both G-CSF and hydrocortisone in the cytokine `` cocktail '' markedly increased the neutrophil numbers .

"Human renal mesangial cells are a target for the anti-inflammatory action of 9-cis retinoic acid . Mesangial cells play an active role in the inflammatory response to glomerular injury . We have studied in cultured human mesangial cells ( CHMC ) several effects of 9-cis retinoic acid ( 9-cRA ) , an activator of both retinoic acid receptors ( RARs ) and retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ) . 9-cRA inhibited foetal calf serum-induced CHMC proliferation . It also prevented CHMC death induced by the inflammatory mediator H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) . This preventive effect was not due to any increase in H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) catabolism and it persisted even when both catalase and glutathione synthesis were inhibited . Finally , 9-cRA diminished monocyte adhesion to FCS-stimulated CHMC . Interestingly , the retinoid also inhibited in FCS-stimulated cells the protein expression of two mesangial adhesion molecules , fibronectin and osteopontin , but it did not modify the protein expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1 . All major RARs and RXRs isotypes were expressed in CHMC regardless of the presence or absence of 9-cRA . Transcripts to RAR-alpha , RAR-beta and RXR-alpha increased after incubation with 9-cRA whereas RXR-gamma was inhibited , suggesting a major role for RARs and RXRs in 9-cRA-anti-inflammatory effects . 9-cRA was toxic only at 50 microM ( a concentration 50 - 5000 times higher than required for the effects above ) . Cell death occurred by apoptosis , whose onset was associated with a pronounced increase in catalase activity and reduced glutathione content , being more effectively induced by all-trans retinoic acid . Modulation of the oxidant/antioxidant balance failed to inhibit apoptosis . We conclude that mesangial cells might be a target for the treatment of inflammatory glomerulopathies with 9-cRA .",gene
"Expression of mammalian defensin genes . Antimicrobial peptides are a prevalent mechanism of host defense found throughout nature . In mammals , defensins are among the most abundant of these broad-spectrum antibiotics , and are expressed in epithelial and hematopoietic cells . The defensin peptides are especially abundant in neutrophils ; however , gene expression is limited to the promyelocyte stage . In epithelial cells , defensin genes are found as both constitutively expressed and inducible . Induction has been observed in vitro by stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide as well as inflammatory mediators . In vivo , up-regulation of several defensin genes occurs in both infectious and inflammatory states . Gene regulation occurs via signal transduction pathways common to other innate immune responses , utilizing transcription factors such as nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB and NF interleukin-6 . Together , the data suggest a broad-based innate host defense whereby potent antimicrobial peptides are present to prevent initial colonization by pathogenic microorganisms . In addition , the recognition of bacteria coupled with a nascent inflammatory response can bolster this defense by a coordinated up-regulation of the peptides .",gene
"Multiple signals required for cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) binding protein interaction induced by CD3/CD28 costimulation . The optimal activation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) , similar to the full activation of T lymphocytes , requires the stimulation of both CD3 and CD28 . Using a reporter system to detect interaction of CREB and CREB-binding protein ( CBP ) , in this study we found that CREB binds to CBP only by engagement of both CD3 and CD28 . CD3/CD28 -promoted CREB - CBP interaction was dependent on p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) IV in addition to the previously identified extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway . Extracellular signal-regulated kinase , CaMKIV , and p38 MAPK were also the kinases involved in CREB Ser ( 133 ) phosphorylation induced by CD3/CD28 . A reconstitution experiment illustrated that optimum CREB - CBP interaction and CREB trans-activation were attained when these three kinase pathways were simultaneously activated in T cells . Our results demonstrate that coordinated activation of different kinases leads to full activation of CREB . Notably , CD28 ligation activated p38 MAPK and CaMKIV , the kinases stimulated by CD3 engagement , suggesting that CD28 acts by increasing the activation extent of p38 MAPK and CaMKIV . These results support the model of a minimum activation threshold for CREB - CBP interaction that can be reached only when both CD3 and CD28 are stimulated .",gene
"The murine IL-2 promoter contains distal regulatory elements responsive to the Ah receptor , a member of the evolutionarily conserved bHLH-PAS transcription factor family . Signaling through the TCR and costimulatory signals primarily control transcription of the IL-2 gene in naive T cells . The minimal promoter necessary for this expression lies proximal , between -300 and the transcription start site . We had previously shown that activation of the arylhydrocarbon receptor ( AHR ) , a member of the bHLH-PAS family of transcription factors , leads to increased mRNA expression of IL-2 in murine fetal thymocytes . The AHR is abundant in the thymus and may play a role for the development of the immune system . Moreover , its overactivation by chemicals such as dioxins leads to immunosuppression and thymic involution . Binding motifs for the liganded AHR can be identified in the distal region -1300 to -800 of the mouse IL-2 promoter . We show here that these DNA motifs , the so-called dioxin response elements , after binding to the liganded AHR are sufficient to transactivate luciferase expression in a reporter gene system . The IL-2 gene can be induced by the AHR also in thymocytes in vivo after injection of 2 , 3 , 7 , 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin , a potent ligand of the AHR . The AHR mediates the IL-2 induction as shown with AHR -deficient mice . However , in spleen cells in vitro costimulation via the TCR is necessary for optimal IL-2 gene induction . Thus , the IL-2 promoter region contains novel distal regulatory elements that can be addressed by the AHR to induce IL-2 and can cooperate with the proximal promoter",gene
"Visualization of Syk-antigen receptor interactions using green fluorescent protein : differential roles for Syk and Lyn in the regulation of receptor capping and internalization . The cross-linking of the B cell Ag receptor ( BCR ) is coupled to the stimulation of multiple intracellular signal transduction cascades via receptor-associated , protein tyrosine kinases of both the Src and Syk families . To monitor changes in the subcellular distribution of Syk in B cells responding to BCR cross-linking , we expressed in Syk -deficient DT40 B cells a fusion protein consisting of Syk coupled to green fluorescent protein . Treatment of these cells with anti-IgM Abs leads to the recruitment of the kinase from cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments to the site of the cross-linked receptor at the plasma membrane . The Syk-receptor complexes aggregate into membrane patches that redistribute to form a cap at one pole of the cell . Syk is not demonstrably associated with the internalized receptor . Catalytically active Syk promotes and stabilizes the formation of tightly capped BCR complexes at the plasma membrane . Lyn is not required for the recruitment of Syk to the cross-linked receptor , but is required for the internalization of the clustered BCR complexes . In the absence of Lyn , receptor-Syk complexes at the plasma membrane are long lived , and the receptor-mediated activation of the NF-AT transcription factor is enhanced . Thus , Lyn appears to function to negatively regulate aspects of BCR -dependent signaling by stimulating receptor internalization and down-regulation .",gene
"Renal interstitial fibrosis is reduced in angiotensin II type 1a receptor -deficient mice . Unilateral ureteral obstruction ( UUO ) results in tubulointerstitial fibrosis of the affected kidney by stimulating the renin-angiotensin system . This study established a UUO model in angiotensin type 1a receptor ( AT1a ) deficient ( mutant ) mice to elucidate the role of angiotensin II through AT1a on the fibrosis of the obstructed kidney ( OBK ) . The relative volume of the tubulointerstitium was measured by an image analyzer ; deposition of collagen types III and IV and monocyte / macrophage infiltration were histologically examined using specific antibodies . Also determined were the mRNA levels of transforming growth factor-beta by Northern blot analysis . Nuclear factor-kappaB activity was assessed by gel shift assay . UUO in wild mice resulted in a marked expansion of relative volume of the tubulointerstitium , together with increased deposition of collagen types III and IV and number of infiltrated monocytes / macrophages in the interstitium , relative to sham-operated mice . In comparison , these changes were significantly lower in mutant mice with UUO . The mRNA level of transforming growth factor-beta was significantly higher in the OBK of wild mice with UUO compared with sham-operated mice . In contrast , the increase in mRNA level in the OBK of mutant mice was significantly less than in wild mice . Finally , UUO resulted in activation of nuclear factor-kappaB in wild mice but was inhibited in the OBK of mutant mice . The results provide direct evidence that angiotensin II acting via the AT1a plays a pivotal role in the development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in UUO .",gene

Ag-specific CD4+ T cells are present in peripheral blood in low frequency , where they undergo recruitment and expansion during immune responses and in the pathogenesis of numerous autoimmune diseases . MHC tetramers , which constitute a labeled MHC-peptide ligand suitable for binding to the Ag-specific receptor on T cells , provide a novel approach for the detection and characterization of such rare cells . In this study , we utilized this technology to identify HLA DQ -restricted Ag-specific T cells in the peripheral blood of human subjects and to identify immunodominant epitopes associated with viral infection . Peptides representing potential epitope regions of the VP16 protein from HSV-2 were loaded onto recombinant DQ0602 molecules to generate a panel of Ag-specific DQ0602 tetramers . VP16 Ag -specific DQ-restricted T cells were identified and expanded from the peripheral blood of HSV-2-infected individuals , representing two predominant epitope specificities .

"Down-regulation of BOB.1/OBF.1 and Oct2 in classical Hodgkin disease but not in lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin disease correlates with immunoglobulin transcription . In contrast to the tumor cells ( L & H cells ) of lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin disease ( LPHD ) , Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg ( HRS ) cells of classical Hodgkin disease ( cHD ) are unable to transcribe immunoglobulin , despite the presence of rearranged immunoglobulin genes . Although initial studies have suggested crippling immunoglobulin gene mutations to be the cause of absent immunoglobulin expression in cHD , recent work of our group has demonstrated an impaired activation of the immunoglobulin promoter as a superior mechanism . As immunoglobulin transcription is mainly regulated by the B-cell transcription factors Oct2 and BOB.1/OBF.1 , we analyzed 35 cases of LPHD , 32 cases of cHD , and 2 Hodgkin disease cell lines for the expression of these transcription factors and also in parallel for immunoglobulin expression . Our results demonstrate an absence of Oct2 and/or BOB.1/OBF.1 in cHD and a striking overexpression of Oct2 in LPHD . Immunoglobulin expression was lacking in cHD but present in LPHD . Furthermore , the reintroduction of BOB.1/OBF.1 and Oct2 into cultured HRS cells restored the activity of cotransduced immunoglobulin promoter constructs . Our findings dismiss the concept that the different immunoglobulin expression in cHD and LPHD is due to disrupting mutations of immunoglobulin V genes in cHD but is most likely due to a down-regulation of Oct2 and/or BOB.1/OBF.1 .

"Constitutive expression of NF-kappa B is a characteristic feature of mycosis fungoides : implications for apoptosis resistance and pathogenesis . The NF-kappa B family of transcription factors is an important regulator of genes expressed during inflammatory responses , immunoglobulin ( Ig ) class switching , cellular differentiation , and apoptosis . Recently , members of the NF-kappaB family , including p65 ( Rel A ) , have been implicated in promoting survival of various hematopoeitic neoplasms , including T cell malignancies such as adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma . We investigated the expression of active NF-kappa B p65 ( Rel A ) in cases of mycosis fungoides ( MF ) and the effect of chemical inhibitors of NF-kappa B on apoptosis in cutaneous T cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) cell lines . Paraffin-embedded tissues from 23 cutaneous lesions and a single lymph node biopsy from patients diagnosed with MF were evaluated for p65 ( Rel A ) expression by using a monoclonal mouse antibody that detects the activated form of p65 ( Rel A ) . Apoptosis after treatment with the NF-kappa B inhibitors gliotoxin , MG132 , BAY 11-7082 , and BAY 11-7085 was quantitatively measured in the CTCL cell lines HuT-78 and HH by propidium iodide ( PI ) /cell cycle analysis for detection of a hypodiploid ( sub-G ( 0 ) ) population and by determination of increased Annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin D ( 7-AAD ) expression . Nuclear extracts from CTCL cells before and after chemical inhibition were analyzed for NF-kappa B nuclear DNA-binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) with quantitative densitometry . Nuclear expression of p65 ( Rel A ) before and after treatment with the various inhibitory compounds was measured by immunofluorescence staining in each CTCL cell line .

"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 tax protein activates transcription through AP-1 site by inducing DNA binding activity in T cells . Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) Tax protein induces the expression of various family members of the transcription factor AP-1 , such as c-Jun , JunD , c-Fos , and Fra-1 , at the level of RNA expression in T cells . We examined the activity of Tax in transcription through AP-1-binding sites ( AP-1 site ) in T cells . Transient transfection studies showed that Tax activated the expression of a luciferase gene regulated by two copies of an AP-1 site in the human Jurkat T-cell line . Tax activates the expression of viral and cellular genes through two different enhancers : a cAMP-responsive ( CRE ) -like element and a kappaB element . Two Tax mutants differentially activated expression of these two elements . Tax703 preferentially activated the kappaB element but not the CRE-like one , whereas TaxM22 showed the reverse . In addition , Tax703 and Tax , but not TaxM22 , converted cell growth of a mouse T-cell line from being interleukin ( IL ) -2-dependent to being IL-2-independent . Unlike the wild-type Tax , Tax703 and TaxM22 only weakly activated the AP-1 site in the T-cell line . Thus , Tax seems to activate the AP-1 site via mechanisms distinct from those of kappaB or CRE-like elements , and the activation of the AP-1 site is dispensable for IL-2-independent growth of CTLL-2 . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that Tax induced strong binding activity to an AP-1 site in CTLL-2 , whereas Tax703 did not , indicating that the induction of binding activity to the AP-1 site is essential for the transcriptional activation by Tax . The binding complex induced by Tax in CTLL-2 contained JunD and Fra-2 . Other AP-1 proteins were undetectable . Activation of transcription through the AP-1 site in Jurkat cells by JunD and/or Fra-2 was weak . c-Jun , JunB , and c-Fos activation was greater , although the level was still less",gene

"Strict control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication by a genetic switch : Tet for Tat . Live-attenuated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) variants have shown great promise as AIDS vaccines , but continued replication can lead to the selection of faster-replicating variants that are pathogenic . We therefore designed HIV-1 genomes that replicate exclusively upon addition of the nontoxic effector doxycycline ( dox ) . This was achieved by replacement of the viral TAR-Tat system for transcriptional activation by the Escherichia coli-derived Tet system for inducible gene expression . These designer `` HIV-rtTA '' viruses replicate in a strictly dox-dependent manner both in a T-cell line and in primary blood cells , and the rate of replication can be fine-tuned by simple variation of the dox concentration . These HIV-rtTA viruses provide a tool to perform genetics , e.g. , selection and optimization experiments , with the E. coli-derived Tet reagents in a eukaryotic background . Furthermore , such viruses may represent improved vaccine candidates because their replication can be turned on and off at will .",gene
"Synovial fluid induced nuclear factor-kappaB DNA binding in a monocytic cell line . OBJECTIVE : To determine the effects of synovial fluids ( SF ) on DNA binding activity of transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) in the Mono Mac 6 monocytic/macrophage cell line as a model for the interaction between SF and synovial tissue macrophages in arthritis . METHODS : Mono Mac 6 cells were incubated with SF from the knee joints of human subjects with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , undifferentiated seronegative oligoarthritis , and osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Nuclear extracts prepared from the Mono Mac 6 cells and RA synovial tissue were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis ( EMSA ) for NF-kappaB DNA binding proteins . RESULTS : Induction of NF-kappaB DNA binding by the p65 ( RelA ) /p50 heterodimer was observed in response to incubation of Mono Mac 6 cells with SF ( 20 % in culture medium ) from 5 of 8 subjects with RA , 4 of 5 with OA , and none of 3 with undifferentiated seronegative oligoarthritis . Incubation of SF with neutralizing antibodies against tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , but not antibodies against interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , significantly reduced the induction of p65/p50 binding activity in SF from subjects with RA and OA . Unexpectedly , a slowly migrating SF inducible NF-kappaB -binding complex was observed in EMSA of Mono Mac 6 cells after incubation with SF from 5 of 8 RA and 2 of 5 OA subjects . The induction of this complex by SF was not affected by neutralization of TNF-alpha or IL-6 in SF , and the complex was not inducible by TNF-alpha , IL-1beta , TNF-alpha / IL-1beta , IL-6 , platelet derived growth factor , lipopolysaccharide , or tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate .

CONCLUSION : Biological activity of TNF-alpha in SF from RA and OA subjects is capable of inducing p65/p50 NF-kappaB DNA binding activity in macrophages . A property of SF that is independent of TNF-alpha and other cytokines is responsible for the induction of a novel slowly migrating NF-kappaB-binding complex . Soluble mediators in SF of subjects with RA and OA can therefore modulate binding of nuclear proteins to the NF-kappaB binding site in macrophages and may play a role in inflammatory gene expression in arthritis .",gene
"Peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma agonists and 15-deoxy-Delta ( 12 , 14 ) ( 12 , 14 ) -PGJ ( 2 ) induce apoptosis in normal and malignant B-lineage cells . The research described herein evaluates the expression and functional significance of peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma ( PPAR-gamma ) on B-lineage cells . Normal mouse B cells and a variety of B lymphoma cells reflective of stages of B cell differentiation ( e.g. , 70Z/3 , CH31 , WEHI-231 , CH12 , and J558 ) express PPAR-gamma mRNA and , by Western blot analysis , the 67-kDa PPAR-gamma protein . 15-Deoxy-Delta ( 12 , 14 ) -PGJ ( 2 ) ( 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) ) , a PPAR-gamma agonist , has a dose-dependent antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect on normal and malignant B cells as shown by [ ( 3 ) H ] thymidine and 3- [ 4 , 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl ] -2 , 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays . Only PPAR-gamma agonists ( thiazolidinediones ) , and not PPAR-alpha agonists , mimicked the effect of 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) on B-lineage cells , indicating that the mechanism by which 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) negatively affects B-lineage cells involves in part PPAR-gamma . The mechanism by which PPAR-gamma agonists induce cytotoxicity is via apoptosis , as shown by annexin V staining and as confirmed by DNA fragmentation detected using the TUNEL assay . Interestingly , addition of PGF ( 2alpha ) , which was not known to affect lymphocytes , dramatically attenuated the deleterious effects of PPAR-gamma agonists on B lymphomas . Surprisingly , 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) induced a massive increase in nuclear mitogen-activated protein kinase activation , and pretreatment with PGF ( 2alpha ) blunted the mitogen-activated protein kinase activation .",gene

"Inhibition of STAT3 signaling leads to apoptosis of leukemic large granular lymphocytes and decreased Mcl-1 expression . Large granular lymphocyte ( LGL ) leukemia is characterized by the expansion of antigen-activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes . These leukemic cells are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis despite expressing high levels of Fas . We found that leukemic LGL from 19 patients displayed high levels of activated STAT3 . Treatment of leukemic LGL with the JAK-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG-490 induced apoptosis with a corresponding decrease in STAT -DNA binding activity . Moreover , using an antisense oligonucleotide approach to diminish STAT3 expression , we found that Fas sensitivity was restored in leukemic LGL . AG-490-induced apoptosis in leukemic LGL was independent of Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 expression . However , we found that the Bcl-2-family protein Mcl-1 was significantly reduced by AG-490 treatment . Activated STAT3 was shown to bind an SIE-related element in the murine mcl-1 promoter . Using a luciferase reporter assay , we demonstrated that v-src overexpression in NIH3T3 induced STAT3 -dependent transcriptional activity from the mcl-1 promoter and increased endogenous Mcl-1 protein levels . We conclude that STAT3 activation contributed to accumulation of the leukemic LGL clones . These findings suggest that investigation should focus on novel strategies targeting STAT3 in the treatment of LGL leukemia .",gene

Within 3 h of challenge by LPS , ATF-2 mutant mice had decreased induction of the adhesion molecules E-selectin , P-selectin and VCAM-1 as well as the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha , IL-1beta and IL-6 compared with control mice . Stimulation of T lymphocytes by anti-CD3 antibody also showed less induction of IL-1 and IL-6 in ATF-2 mutant tissues . ATF-2 mutant thymocytes treated with anti-CD3 antibody in vitro demonstrated reduced induction of c-Jun , JunB , JunD and Fra-2 . However , similar to what was observed after p38 kinase inhibition in normal mice , relative ATF-2 deficiency did not prevent the development of a mononuclear cell infiltrate in the week following an inflammatory stimulus . ATF-2 mutant mice proved more susceptible to death than control mice from LPS plus D-galactosamine injection or Coxsackievirus B3 infection and had a higher incidence of mononuclear pulmonary infiltrates after exposure to Herpes simplex virus-1 . ATF-2 is essential for maximal immediate induction of adhesion molecules and cytokine genes , but at later time points may even protect against overactive immune responses .",gene
"LIGHT , a TNF-like molecule , costimulates T cell proliferation and is required for dendritic cell -mediated allogeneic T cell response . LIGHT is a recently identified member of the TNF superfamily and its receptors , herpesvirus entry mediator and lymphotoxin beta receptor , are found in T cells and stromal cells . In this study , we demonstrate that LIGHT is selectively expressed on immature dendritic cells ( DCs ) generated from human PBMCs . In contrast , LIGHT is not detectable in DCs either freshly isolated from PBMCs or rendered mature in vitro by LPS treatment . Blockade of LIGHT by its soluble receptors , lymphotoxin beta receptor-Ig or HVEM-Ig , inhibits the induction of DC -mediated primary allogeneic T cell response . Furthermore , engagement of LIGHT costimulates human T cell proliferation , amplifies the NF-kappaB signaling pathway , and preferentially induces the production of IFN-gamma , but not IL-4 , in the presence of an antigenic signal . Our results suggest that LIGHT is a costimulatory molecule involved in DC -mediated cellular immune responses .",gene
"Suppression of HIV type 1 replication by a dominant-negative Ets-1 mutant . Activity of the distal region of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , which contains binding sites for the Ets-1 and USF-1 proteins , is integral for HIV-1 replication . The Ets-1 and USF-1 proteins play a critical role in the activity of the HIV-1 LTR distal enhancer region , as indicated by the potent dominant negative effect of a mutant Ets-1 lacking trans-activation domains on the transcriptional activity of the LTR . To determine the biological relevance of the Ets-1 and USF-1 proteins in HIV-1 replication , we examined the effect of expression of the dominant-negative mutant of Ets-1 ( dnEts-1 ) on HIV-1 infection of T cells . We demonstrated that expression of dnEts markedly suppressed HIV-1 infection of a T cell line . This finding indicates that formation of a transcriptionaly active USF-1/Ets-1 complex is important in the productive infection of cells by HIV-1 , and suggests that inhibition of the interaction between USF-1 and Ets-1 with the HIV-1 LTR may provide a new target for anti-HIV-1 gene therapy .",gene
"Human eosinophils constitutively express nuclear factor of activated T cells p and c . BACKGROUND : Eosinophils are now known to produce a variety of proinflammatory cytokines , although the molecular factors that regulate their production are poorly understood . The expression of almost all of the cytokines produced by eosinophils , including the proallergic cytokine IL-4 , is now known to be regulated at the level of transcription by members of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family of transcription factors . OBJECTIVE : We sought to characterize the expression of different NFAT proteins in resting and activated eosinophils . METHODS : Nuclear and whole cell extracts were obtained from both peripheral blood eosinophils and those obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asthmatic subjects after endobronchial allergen challenge . NFAT expression was determined by using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis , DNA-binding assays , and RT-PCR analysis of eosinophil mRNA . RESULTS : Both peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid eosinophils expressed NFATp and NFATc protein . Unlike activated T cells , which express multiple NFATc isoforms , eosinophils preferentially express the approximately 85-kd isoform . In addition , eosinophils were found to constitutively express NFATc mRNA . A brief incubation with the T ( H ) 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 was sufficient to induce the nuclear translocation of NFATc . Eosinophil nuclear extracts contain multiple factors that can specifically recognize the IL-4 promoter P1 NFAT site in DNA-binding assays , including NFATp . CONCLUSION : NFATp and NFATc can regulate the expression of cytokines and other genes in eosinophils but appear to be regulated by a novel signal transduction mechanism in these cells .",gene
"BLyS BINDS TO B CELLS WITH HIGH AFFINITY AND INDUCES ACTIVATION OF THE TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS NF-kappaB AND ELF-1 . B lymphocyte stimulator ( BLyS ) is a novel member of the TNF family of proteins expressed by myeloid cells as membrane-bound and soluble forms . BLyS was shown to act specifically on B cells , inducing proliferation and immunoglobulin production both in vitro and in vivo . The present study was undertaken to characterize binding of radiolabeled BLyS to its cognate receptor on human B lymphocytes and examine intracellular events initiated by BLyS binding . Similar to other TNF family members , BLyS is present in solution as a homotrimer as determined by gel filtration chromatography and light scattering analysis . BLyS binding to B cells is specific as other TNF family members tested did not compete for ( 125 ) I- BLyS binding . Analysis of equilibrium binding of ( 125 ) I-labeled BLyS to purified human tonsillar B cells demonstrated saturable binding . Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed a single class of high-affinity binding on human B cells with approximately 2600 binding sites per cell and an apparent dissociation constant ( K ( D ) ) of about 0.1 nM . In addition we report that BLyS binding to B cells results in the activation of NF-kappaB and the Ets family transcription factor , ELF-1 , and in the induction of mRNA for Polo-like kinase ( PLK ) .

"Design and use of an inducibly activated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef to study immune modulation . The Nef protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) has been shown to enhance the infectivity of virus particles , downmodulate cell surface proteins , and associate with many intracellular proteins that are thought to facilitate HIV infection . One of the challenges in defining the molecular events regulated by Nef has been obtaining good expression of Nef protein in T cells . This has been attributed to effects of Nef on cell proliferation and apoptosis . We have designed a Nef protein that is readily expressed in T-cell lines and whose function is inducibly activated . It is composed of a fusion between full-length Nef and the estrogen receptor hormone-binding domain ( Nef-ER ) . The Nef-ER is kept in an inactive state due to steric hindrance , and addition of the membrane-permeable drug 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( 4-HT ) , which binds to the ER domain , leads to inducible activation of Nef-ER within cells . We demonstrate that Nef-ER inducibly associates with the 62-kDa Ser/Thr kinase and is localized to specific membrane microdomains ( lipid rafts ) only after activation . Using this inducible Nef , we also compared the specific requirements for CD4 and HLA-A2 downmodulation in a SupT1 T-cell line . Half-maximal downmodulation of cell surface CD4 required very little active Nef-ER and occurred as early as 4 h after addition of 4-HT . In contrast , 50 % downmodulation of HLA-A2 by Nef required 16 to 24 h and about 50- to 100-fold-greater concentrations of 4-HT . These data suggest that HLA-A2 downmodulation may require certain threshold levels of active Nef . The differential timing of CD4 and HLA-A2 downmodulation may have implications for HIV pathogenesis and immune evasion .",gene
"Regulation of chemokine mRNA expression in a rat model of vanadium-induced pulmonary inflammation . Environmental and occupational exposure to vanadium dusts results in toxic effects mainly confined to the respiratory system . Using a rat model of acute lung inflammation induced by intratracheal instillation of sodium metavanadate ( NaVO3 ) at the dose of 200 microg V/kg , we investigated the relationship between the cytologic characterization of pulmonary inflammation and the expression of chemokine mRNA . Significant polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( PMN ) influx ( P < 0.01 ) into the lung was noted 4 h after NaVO3 instillation , whereas alveolar macrophages ( AMs ) in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) cells appeared to decrease significantly . In contrast , neither PMNs nor AMs changed substantially 1 h after NaVO3 instillation . By Northern analysis , macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) -2 mRNA in BAL cells increased markedly 1 h after NaVO3 instillation and reduced a little bit at 4 h , whereas MIP-1alpha mRNA in BAL cells was expressed relatively high 1 h after NaVO3 instillation , although a basal expression was detected in control group , and returned rapidly nearly to control level at 4 h . Since MIP-2 is a potent PMN chemoattractant and MIP-1alpha is a potent macrophage/monocyte chemoattractant has been well known . The facts that PMN influx was preceded by increased MIP-2 mRNA expression , suggesting that MIP-2 is involved in the development of NaVO3-induced pulmonary inflammation , whereas increased MIP-1alpha mRNA expression was followed by decreased AMs in BAL cells , suggesting AMs might be activated by MIP-1alpha , adherent to the lining surface of the airways and then resistant to be washed out . To delineate the mechanisms of transcriptional activation , we recently cloned the 5'-flanking region of the MIP-2 gene . The promotor region contains consensus binding sites for transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) .

Taken together , our studies suggest that MIP-2 is an important mediator of NaVO3-induced pulmonary inflammation in the rat model . In addition , elevated MIP-2 mRNA levels are accompanied by increased NF-kappaB binding activity in BAL cells , suggesting possible MIP-2 transcriptional regulation through NF-kappaB .",gene
"Activation of signal transduction and apoptosis in healthy lymphomonocytes exposed to bystander HIV-1-infected cells . Persistent activation of the immune system is one of the hallmarks of HIV-1 infection . In this study we analysed the induction of factors involved in cytokine signal transduction , such as STAT 1 proteins and IRF-1 mRNA , in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) exposed to HIV-infected cells , and the induction of apoptosis . Western blot analyses and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction results indicate that both cells infected with a X4 strain and cells infected with a R5 strain are able to increase intracellular levels of STAT 1alpha and beta proteins as well as IRF-1 mRNA . This effect was prevented by neutralizing antibodies against interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha ) . HIV-1-infected cells dose-dependently induced apoptotic commitment in normal PBMC , as revealed by DNA fragmentation analysis , but this was not accompanied by an increase of caspase-3 activity , even if a slight up-regulation of IL-1beta-converting enzyme mRNA was detected . Apoptosis induction could be abrogated mainly by antibodies against tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and , to a lesser extent , by antibodies against IFN-gamma . All these findings suggest that uninfected PBMC can undergo activation of signal transduction and apoptosis after exposure to bystander HIV-infected cells , subsequent to the induction of cytokines such as IFNs and TNF-alpha .",gene
"The physical association of protein kinase C theta with a lipid raft-associated inhibitor of kappa B factor kinase ( IKK ) complex plays a role in the activation of the NF-kappa B cascade by TCR and CD28 . We investigated the role of protein kinase C theta ( PKCtheta ) in the activation of the NF-kappaB cascade in primary human CD4 ( + ) lymphocytes . Among six or so PKC isoforms expressed in T cells , only PKCtheta participates in the assembly of the supramolecular activation clusters at the contact site of the TCR with Ag . Signaling via both the TCR and CD28 is required for optimal activation of the multisubunit IkappaB kinase ( IKK ) complex in primary human T lymphocytes ; this activation could be inhibited by a Ca ( 2+ ) -independent PKC isoform inhibitor , rottlerin . Moreover , endogenous PKCtheta physically associates with activated IKK complexes in CD3/CD28-costimulated primary CD4 ( + ) T cells . The same set of stimuli also induced relocation of endogenous PKCtheta and IKKs to a GM1 ganglioside-enriched , detergent-insoluble membrane compartment in primary T cells . IKKs recruited to these lipid rafts were capable of phosphorylating a recombinant IkappaBalpha sustrate . Confocal microscopy further demonstrated that exogenously expressed PKCtheta and IKKss colocalize in the membrane of CD3/CD28-costimulated Jurkat T cells . Constitutively active but not kinase-inactive PKCtheta activated IKKbeta in Jurkat T cells . Expression of dominant-active PKCtheta also had stimulatory effects on the CD28 response element of the IL-2 promoter . Taken together , these data show that the activation of PKCtheta by the TCR and CD28 plays an important role in the assembly and activation of IKK complexes in the T cell membrane",gene
"T-cell -mediated regulation of osteoclastogenesis by signalling cross-talk between RANKL and IFN-gamma . Bone resorption is regulated by the immune system , where T-cell expression of RANKL ( receptor activator of nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB ligand ) , a member of the tumour-necrosis factor family that is essential for osteoclastogenesis , may contribute to pathological conditions , such as autoimmune arthritis . However , whether activated T cells maintain bone homeostasis by counterbalancing the action of RANKL remains unknown . Here we show that T-cell production of interferon ( IFN ) -gamma strongly suppresses osteoclastogenesis by interfering with the RANKL -RANK signalling pathway . IFN-gamma induces rapid degradation of the RANK adapter protein , TRAF6 ( tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 ) , which results in strong inhibition of the RANKL -induced activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and JNK . This inhibition of osteoclastogenesis is rescued by overexpressing TRAF6 in precursor cells , which indicates that TRAF6 is the target critical for the IFN-gamma action . Furthermore , we provide evidence that the accelerated degradation of TRAF6 requires both its ubiquitination , which is initiated by RANKL , and IFN-gamma -induced activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system . Our study shows that there is cross-talk between the tumour necrosis factor and IFN families of cytokines , through which IFN-gamma provides a negative link between T-cell activation and bone resorption . Our results may offer a therapeutic approach to treat the inflammation-induced tissue breakdown .",gene
"Stromal-derived factor 1 and thrombopoietin regulate distinct aspects of human megakaryopoiesis . The role of the chemokine binding stromal-derived factor 1 ( SDF-1 ) in normal human megakaryopoiesis at the cellular and molecular levels and its comparison with that of thrombopoietin ( TPO ) have not been determined . In this study it was found that SDF-1 , unlike TPO , does not stimulate alpha ( IIb ) beta ( 3 ) ( + ) cell proliferation or differentiation or have an antiapoptotic effect . However , it does induce chemotaxis , trans-Matrigel migration , and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) by these cells , and both SDF-1 and TPO increase the adhesion of alpha ( IIb ) beta ( 3 ) ( + ) cells to fibrinogen and vitronectin . Investigating the intracellular signaling pathways induced by SDF-1 and TPO revealed some overlapping patterns of protein phosphorylation/activation ( mitogen-activated protein kinase [ MAPK ] p42/44 , MAPK p38 , and AKT [ protein kinase B ] ) and some that were distinct for TPO ( eg , JAK-STAT ) and for SDF-1 ( eg , NF-kappa B ) . It was also found that though inhibition of phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase ( PI-3K ) by LY294002 in alpha ( IIb ) beta ( 3 ) ( + ) cells induced apoptosis and inhibited chemotaxis adhesion and the secretion of MMP-9 and VEGF , the inhibition of MAPK p42/44 ( by the MEK inhibitor U0126 ) had no effect on the survival , proliferation , and migration of these cells . Hence , it is suggested that the proliferative effect of TPO is more related to activation of the JAK-STAT pathway ( unique to TPO ) , and the PI-3K-AKT axis is differentially involved in TPO- and SDF-1-dependent signaling . Accordingly , PI-3K is",gene

"Adhesion of immature and mature T cells induces in human thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) activation of IL-6 gene trascription factors ( NF-kappaB and NF-IL6 ) and IL-6 gene expression : role of alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 integrins . T cell precursors homed to thymus develop in close contact with stromal cells . Among them , thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) are known to exert dominant roles in their survival and functional shaping . Key molecules mediating TEC / thymocytes interactions include cytokines and growth factors secreted by the two cell types and adhesion receptors mediating cell contact . Signaling events triggered in thymocytes by adhesion to epithelial cells have been extensively investigated , whereas little is known on the opposite phenomenon . We have previously investigated this issue in a co-culture system composed of TEC cultures derived from human normal thymus and heterologous thymocytes . We demonstrated that thymocytes adhere to TEC involving beta1 and beta4 integrins and induce the clustering of alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 heterodimers at the TEC surface . In addition thymocyte adhesion was followed by activation of NF-kappaB and NF-IL6 gene transcription factors and enhanced IL-6 production . The two latter phenomena were reproduced by the cross-linking of the alpha3 , alpha6 , beta1 and beta4 integrins , thus implying that the alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 heterodimers can signal during thymocyte adhesion .

"Identification and characterization of SKAT-2 , a novel Th2-specific zinc finger gene . We have identified a novel Kruppel-type zinc finger ( ZF ) gene , SKAT-2 , which is selectively expressed by murine Th2 cells . The protein encoded by this gene has 14 C2H2-type ZF tandemly arrayed at its C terminus and N-terminal SCAN box and KRAB domains . SKAT-2 is tissue restricted in expression at the RNA level , detectable only in brain and at low levels in kidney and spleen and few hematopoietic cell lines . By in situ hybridization , SKAT-2 expression was found to peak in antigen-stimulated CD4 ( + ) T cells after 2-3 days of culture under Th2 but not Th1 biasing conditions . This pattern of expression closely mirrored that of GATA-3 in the same cells . In transient transfection experiments in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin-stimulated EL4 cells , SKAT-2 was found to up-regulate the activity of the IL-4 but not the IL-5 promoter , contrasting with the ability of GATA-3 to activate both promoters . This result was confirmed using clones of EL4 cells stably expressing an inducible form of SKAT-2 , thus SKAT-2 is a novel Th2-specific gene that may play a role in selective regulation of cytokine genes in T cells .",gene
"hsp70 interacting protein Hip does not affect glucocorticoid receptor folding by the hsp90-based chaperone machinery except to oppose the effect of BAG-1 .

Using purified proteins , we have prepared a five-protein heterocomplex assembly system consisting of two proteins essential for heterocomplex assembly- hsp90 and hsp70 -and three proteins that act as co-chaperones to enhance assembly- Hop , hsp40 , p23 [ Morishima , Y. , Kanelakis , K.

The hsp70 co-chaperone Hip has been recovered in receptor.hsp90 heterocomplexes at an intermediate stage of assembly in reticulocyte lysate , and Hip is also thought to be an intrinsic component of the assembly machinery . Here we show that immunodepletion of Hip from reticulocyte lysate or addition of high levels of Hip to the purified five-protein system does not affect GR.hsp90 heterocomplex assembly or the activation of steroid binding activity that occurs with assembly . Despite the fact that Hip does not affect assembly , it is recovered in GR.hsp90 heterocomplexes assembled by both systems . In the five-protein system , Hip prevents inhibition of assembly by the hsp70 co-chaperone BAG-1 , and cotransfection of Hip with BAG-1 opposes BAG-1 reduction of steroid binding activity in COS cells . We conclude that Hip is not a component of the assembly machinery but that it could play a regulatory role in opposition to BAG-1 .",gene
"Cutting edge : STAT6-deficient mice have enhanced tumor immunity to primary and metastatic mammary carcinoma . STAT4 and STAT6 are essential for the development of CD4 ( + ) Th1 and Th2 development , respectively . Tumor immunologists have hypothesized that Th1 cells are critical in tumor immunity because they facilitate differentiation of CD8 ( + ) T cells , which are potent anti-tumor effectors . We have used STAT4 ( -/- ) and STAT6 ( -/- ) mice to test this hypothesis . BALB/c and knockout mice were challenged in the mammary gland with the highly malignant and spontaneously metastatic BALB/c-derived 4T1 mammary carcinoma . Primary tumor growth and metastatic disease are reduced in STAT6 ( -/- ) mice relative to BALB/c and STAT4 ( -/- ) mice . Ab depletions demonstrate that the effect is mediated by CD8 ( + ) T cells , and immunized STAT6 ( -/- ) mice have higher levels of 4T1-specific CTL than BALB/c or STAT4 ( -/- ) mice . Surprisingly , Th1 or Th2 cells are not involved , because CD4 depletion does not diminish the anti-tumor effect . Therefore , deletion of the STAT6 gene facilitates development of potent anti-tumor immunity via a CD4 ( + ) -independent pathway .",gene
"Activation of oncogenic transcription factor AP-1 in T cells infected with human T cell leukemia virus type 1 . Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) Tax protein transforms primary human T cells in vitro . We previously showed that Tax induces the expression of various family members of the transcription factor AP-1 such as c-Jun , JunD , c-Fos , and Fra-1 at the mRNA level in T cells . In this study , we have examined the ability of Tax to activate transcription through the AP-1-binding site ( AP-1 site ) . A transient transfection study showed that Tax can activate transcription through the AP-1-binding site in a human T cell line , whereas any combination of AP-1 proteins did so much less than Tax , indicating that the activation of the AP-1 site by Tax may require a mechanism other than the induction of AP-1 mRNA . Fresh peripheral blood leukemia cells of all surveyed ATL patients displayed constitutive AP-1 DNA-binding activity , whereas no normal individuals did . However , the HTLV-1 genes , including tax , are not significantly expressed in fresh leukemia cells from ATL patients . Our present results suggest that activation of AP-1 occurs through Tax-dependent and -independent mechanisms in HTLV-1-infected T cells , which may play some roles in dysregulated phenotypes of HTLV-1-infected cells .",gene

This suggests a possibly separate mechanism by which PCBs cause immunosuppression .",gene
"Effects of deregulated Raf activation on integrin , cytokine-receptor expression and the induction of apoptosis in hematopoietic cells . The effects of deregulated Raf activation on the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells were investigated . The cytokine-dependent murine myeloid FDC-P1 and human erythroleukemic TF-1 cell lines were transformed to grow in response to deregulated Raf expression in the absence of exogenous cytokines . The conditionally active Raf proteins were regulated by beta-estradiol as cDNAs containing the Raf catalytic , but lacking negative-regulatory domains , were ligated to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor ( deltaRaf : ER ) . Continuous deltaRaf expression prevented apoptosis in the absence of exogenous cytokines and altered the morphology of the FD/deltaRaf : ER cells as they grew in large aggregated masses ( > 100 cells ) whereas the parental cytokine-dependent FDC-P1 cells grew in smaller grape-like clusters ( < 10 cells ) . FD/deltaRaf-1 : ER cells growing in response to Raf activation displayed decreased levels of the Mac-2 and Mac-3 molecules on their cell surface . In contrast , when these cells were cultured in IL-3 , higher levels of these adhesion molecules were detected . Expression of activated Raf oncoproteins also abrogated cytokine dependency and prevented apoptosis of TF-1 cells . Moreover , the differentiation status of these Raf-responsive cells was more immature upon Raf activation as culture with the differentiation-inducing agent phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and beta-estradiol resulted in decreased levels of the CD11b and CD18 integrin molecules on the cell surface . In contrast when the Raf-responsive cells were induced to differentiate with PMA and GM-CSF , in the absence of deltaRaf : ER activation , increased levels of the CD11b and CD18 molecules were detected .

"Cyclic AMP activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in Th2 cells : phosphorylation of GATA-3 and stimulation of Th2 cytokine gene expression . cAMP is an important second messenger with immunomodulatory properties . Elevation of intracellular cAMP in T cells , induced by agents such as IL-1alpha or PGs , inhibits T cell activation . In effector T cells , an increase in the level of intracellular cAMP inhibits cytokine production in Th1 cells but stimulates cytokine production in Th2 cells . Here we report that cAMP-induced effects in Th2 cells occur independently of the protein kinase A pathway , which is the major mediator of cAMP-induced signaling events in most cell types . Instead , cAMP stimulates activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in Th2 cells . This appears to be a Th2 -selective event because cAMP barely increased p38 phosphorylation in Th1 cells . We show that in Th2 cells , cAMP promotes the production of both IL-5 and IL-13 , which play distinct but critical roles in asthma pathogenesis . Our data also show that cAMP causes increased phosphorylation of the transcription factor GATA-3 , which we have shown is a critical regulator of Th2 cytokine gene expression and , in turn , of airway inflammation in mice . Thus , Th2 -specific GATA-3 expression and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation together provide a molecular basis for the differential effects of cAMP in the two T helper cell subsets .",gene
"Characterization of IL-4 and IL-13 signals dependent on the human IL-13 receptor alpha chain 1 : redundancy of requirement of tyrosine residue for STAT3 activation . IL-4 and IL-13 are pleiotropic cytokines whose biological activities overlap with each other . IL-13 receptor alpha chain 1 ( IL-13R alpha 1 ) is necessary for binding to IL-13 , and the heterodimer composed of IL-13R alpha 1 and IL-4R alpha chain transduces IL-13 and IL-4 signals ; however , the functional mapping of the intracellular domain of IL-13R alpha 1 is not fully understood . In this study , we constructed wild and mutated types of human IL-13R alpha 1 , and analyzed IL-4 and IL-13 signals using an IL-13R alpha 1 -transfected human B cell line . Expression of IL-13R alpha 1 evoked STAT3 activation by IL-4 and IL-13 , and in stimulated human B cells , on which IL-13R alpha 1 was highly expressed , IL-4 and IL-13 induced STAT3 activation . Replacement of the two tyrosine residues completely abolished STAT3 activation , although replacing either tyrosine residue alone retained it . Furthermore , we found that the Box1 region and the C-terminal tail of IL-13R alpha 1 were critical for binding to Tyk2 , and activation of Jak1 , Tyk2 , the insulin receptor substrate-1 and STAT6 respectively . These results suggest that STAT3 activation is involved with IL-4 and IL-13 signals in human B cells along with the activation of STAT6 , and that there is a unique sequence in IL-13R alpha 1 to activate STAT3 .",gene
"Functional uncoupling of the Janus kinase 3-Stat5 pathway in malignant growth of human T cell leukemia virus type 1-transformed human T cells . Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) transforms cytokine -dependent T lymphocytes and causes adult T cell leukemia . Janus tyrosine kinase ( Jak ) 3 and transcription factors Stat5a and Stat5b are essential for the proliferation of normal T cells and are constitutively hyperactivated in both HTLV-1-transformed human T cell lines and lymphocytes isolated from HTLV-1-infected patients ; therefore , a critical role for the Jak3-Stat5 pathway in the progression of this disease has been postulated . We recently reported that tyrphostin AG-490 selectively blocked IL-2 activation of Jak3/Stat5 and growth of murine T cell lines . Here we demonstrate that disruption of Jak3/Stat5a/b signaling with AG-490 ( 50 & mgr ; M ) blocked the proliferation of primary human T lymphocytes , but paradoxically failed to inhibit the proliferation of HTLV-1-transformed human T cell lines , HuT-102 and MT-2 . Structural homologues of AG-490 also inhibited the proliferation of primary human T cells , but not HTLV-1-infected cells .

"The Epstein-Barr virus promoter initiating B-cell transformation is activated by RFX proteins and the B-cell-specific activator protein BSAP/Pax5 . Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -induced B-cell growth transformation , a central feature of the virus ' strategy for colonizing the human B-cell system , requires full virus latent gene expression and is initiated by transcription from the viral promoter Wp . Interestingly , when EBV accesses other cell types , this growth-transforming program is not activated . The present work focuses on a region of Wp which in reporter assays confers B-cell -specific activity . Bandshift studies indicate that this region contains three factor binding sites , termed sites B , C , and D , in addition to a previously characterized CREB site . Here we show that site C binds members of the ubiquitously expressed RFX family of proteins , notably RFX1 , RFX3 , and the associated factor MIBP1 , whereas sites B and D both bind the B-cell-specific activator protein BSAP/Pax5 . In reporter assays with mutant Wp constructs , the loss of factor binding to any one of these sites severely impaired promoter activity in B cells , while the wild-type promoter could be activated in non-B cells by ectopic BSAP expression . We suggest that Wp regulation by BSAP helps to ensure the B-cell specificity of EBV 's growth-transforming function .",gene
"Activation of the Lck tyrosine protein kinase by the Herpesvirus saimiri tip protein involves two binding interactions . The Tip protein of Herpesvirus saimiri strain 484C binds to and activates the Lck tyrosine protein kinase . Two sequences in the Tip protein were previously shown to be involved in binding to Lck . A proline-rich region , residues 132-141 , binds to the SH3 domain of the Lck protein . We show here that the other Lck-binding domain , residues 104-113 , binds to the carboxyl-terminal half of Lck and that this binding does not require the Lck SH3 domain . Mutated Tip containing only one functional Lck-binding domain can bind stably to Lck , although not as strongly as wild-type Tip . Interaction of Tip with Lck through either Lck-binding domain increases the activity of Lck in vivo . Simultaneous binding of both domains is required for maximal activation of Lck . The transient expression of Tip in T cells was found to stimulate both Stat3 -dependent and NF-AT -dependent transcription . Mutant forms of Tip lacking one or the other of the two Lck-binding domains retained the ability to stimulate Stat3 -dependent transcription . Tip lacking the proline-rich Lck-binding domain exhibited almost wild-type activity in this assay . In contrast , ablation of either Lck-binding domain abolished the ability of Tip to stimulate NF-AT -dependent transcription . Full biological activity of Tip , therefore , appears to require both Lck-binding domains .",gene
"Accumulation of RXR alpha during activation of cycling human T lymphocytes : modulation of RXRE transactivation function by mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways . We have previously reported that the activation of resting human immature peripheral blood T ( PBT ) lymphocytes is associated with the loss of retinoid X receptor alpha ( RXRalpha ) expression . In the present study , we have demonstrated that , unlike resting cells , activation of cycling human mature PBT lymphocytes , and T lymphocyte leukemia cell lines is accompanied by the accumulation of RXRalpha mRNA and protein . Interestingly , cyclosporin A further augmented RXRalpha expression , indicating the involvement of calcineurin pathways in the process . 9-cis retinoic acid inhibited the accumulation , suggesting that retinoids can regulate the synthesis of their own receptors during T cell activation . Transfection analysis in Jurkat cells , using RXRE-dependent reporter assays , showed that RXRalpha accumulated during T cell activation was transcriptionally inactive . To investigate the mechanism of such inhibition , the role of two mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways , c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) , in modulating RXRE-dependent transcription , was explored . The expression of constitutively active MAP/ERK kinase kinase 1 ( MEKK1 ) inhibited RXRE-dependent transcription , whereas dominant negative MEKK1 increased the transcription , indicating the involvement of JNK signaling pathways in the process . In contrast , expression of constitutively active MEK1 , which activates ERK pathway , enhanced RXRE-dependent activation . When both were activated simultaneously , JNK pathway was dominant over ERK pathway and resulted in inhibition of RXRE-mediated transcription . These data demonstrate a dual regulatory control of RXRalpha expression during the activation of resting and cycling T lymphocytes and indicate a dynamic balance between JNK and ERK pathways in modulating RXRE-mediated transactivation .",gene
"The proteasome regulates receptor-mediated endocytosis of interleukin-2 . Recent studies have increasingly implicated the proteasome in the regulation of cell surface receptors . In the present study , we investigated the role of the proteasome for ligand-dependent endocytosis and degradation of the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) -interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) complex . Proteasome inhibitors impaired internalization of IL-2.IL-2R and prevented the lysosomal degradation of this cytokine . Based on time-course studies , proteasome activity is primarily required after initial endocytosis of the IL-2.IL-2R . Proteasome function was also necessary for the lysosomal degradation of IL-2 internalized by IL-2R that were comprised of cytoplasmic tailless beta- or gamma c-subunits , suggesting that the target protein for the proteasome is independent of either the cytoplasmic tail of the IL-2R beta- or gamma c-subunits and their associated signaling components . Therefore , a functional proteasome is required for optimal endocytosis of the IL-2R/ligand complex and is essential for the subsequent lysosomal degradation of IL-2 , possibly by regulating trafficking to the lysosome .",gene
"Functional characterization of the two alternative promoters of human p45 NF-E2 gene . OBJECTIVE : The transcription factor NF-E2 , a heterodimeric protein complex composed of p45 and small Maf family proteins , is considered crucial for the proper differentiation of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes in vivo . We report the results of studies aimed at understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling p45 gene expression in erythroid cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Human p45 mRNAs have two alternative isoforms , aNF-E2 and fNF-E2 , and these isoforms are transcribed from the alternative promoters . We investigated lineage-specific expression of both isomers in human erythroid and megakaryocytic cells by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or Northern blot analysis . For functional characterization of both promoters , plasmids in which reporter genes were placed under the control of a series of truncated or mutated promoter fragments were transfected to human hematopoietic cell lines . RESULTS : When CD34 ( + ) cells isolated from human cord blood were induced to unilineage erythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation in liquid suspension culture , both transcripts , although barely detected at day 0 , were induced in both erythroid and megakaryocytic cultures . fNF-E2 mRNA was found to be more abundant in erythroid cells than megakaryocytic cells at day 7 of culture . Although both isomers were expressed in human erythroid-megakaryocytic cell lines , megakaryocytic maturation with loss of erythroid phenotype induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) resulted in exclusive downregulation of fNF-E2 , suggesting that fNF-E2 promoter is more erythroid specific . Functional analysis of fNF-E2 promoter showed that the promoter is active only in erythroid-megakaryocytic cells and that the double GATA sit e in the proximal region is necessary for its efficient activity . CONCLUSION : These results suggest that GATA proteins , which govern the differentiation of erythroid lineage cells , are required for full",gene

"Transcriptional activation of heme oxygenase-1 and its functional significance in acetaminophen-induced hepatitis and hepatocellular injury in the rat . BACKGROUND/AIM : Glutathione depletion contributes to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity and is known to induce the oxidative stress reactant heme oxygenase-1 . The metabolites of the heme oxygenase pathway , biliverdin , carbon monoxide , and iron may modulate acetaminophen toxicity . The aim of this study was to assess cell-type specific expression of heme oxygenase-1 and its impact on liver injury and microcirculatory disturbances in a model of acetaminophen-induced hepatitis . METHODS : Gene expression of heme oxygenase-1 was studied by Northern- and Western analysis as well as immunohistochemistry . The time course of heme oxygenase-1 and -2 , cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 , and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was studied by Northern analysis . DNA-binding activity of nuclear factor-kappaB was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . Sinusoidal perfusion and leukocyte-endothelial interactions were assessed by intravital microscopy . RESULTS : Acetaminophen caused a moderate sinusoidal perfusion failure ( -15 % ) and infiltration of neutrophils along with activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 mRNAs . Induction of heme oxygenase-1 mRNA and protein ( approximately 30-fold ) in hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells paralleled the inflammatory response . Blockade of heme oxygenase activity with tin-protoporphyrin-IX abrogated acetaminophen-induced hepatic neutrophil accumulation and nuclear factor-kappaB activation , but failed to affect sinusoidal perfusion and liver injury . CONCLUSIONS : The inflammatory response associated with acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is modulated by the parallel induction of the heme",gene

"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha -induced proliferation requires synthesis of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor . OBJECTIVE : Tumor necrosis factor- alpha ( TNF-alpha ) induces a variety of cellular responses , some of them being at least seemingly contradictory . Thus , we set out to find differences in the modes of proliferative and apoptotic responses to TNF- alpha . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We screened a panel of acute myeloid leukemia-derived cell lines for TNF- alpha -responsiveness . In two lines ( OCI-AML-1 , OCI-AML-11 ) , TNF- alpha acted as an apoptotic agent ; in others ( HU-3 , M-07e , TF-1 ) , it had the opposite effect , preventing apoptosis and inducing proliferation . Direct and indirect signaling mechanisms , including NF-kappaB activation and cytokine synthesis , were analyzed . RESULTS : All cell lines tested expressed TNF- alpha receptors I and II and responded to TNF- alpha by upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 . In contrast to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , TNF- alpha did not activate the MAP kinase and p70S6 kinase pathways . Nevertheless , inhibitors of these pathways clearly reduced the TNF-alpha -induced cell growth , indicating that TNF- alpha-proliferative cells produced a growth factor that induced proliferation upon stimulation of the above pathways . Anti-GM-CSF antibodies inhibited the TNF-alpha -induced growth , suggesting the presence of an autocrine loop for cell proliferation mediated by GM-CSF . Supporting this notion , TNF-alpha -induced upregulation of GM-CSF mRNA levels and protein secretion in the TNF-alpha -proliferative , but not in the TNF-alpha-apoptotic cell lines . CONCLUSION : These data identify GM-CSF synthesis as an early and essential step in TNF- alpha-induced proliferation . We show for the first time that TNF-alpha-treated cell lines producing no or only minimal amounts of GM-CSF demonstrate an apoptotic",gene

"Glucocorticoid receptor content of T lymphocytes : evidence for heterogeneity . Glucocorticoid receptors were measured in T lymphocytes that were isolated from peripheral blood by either nylon wool filtration or E-rosette sedimentation . T cells isolated by nylon wool filtration specifically bind 6.7 +/- 0.2 fmol of dexamethasone per million cells ( equivalent to 4000 +/- 200 receptors per cell ) , whereas T cells isolated by E-rosette sedimentation bind 12.0 +/- 0.7 fmol of dexamethasone per million cells ( equivalent to 7200 +/- 400 receptors per cell ) . This difference in the amount of dexamethasone bound by the two T cell preparations was significant ( p less than .001 ) and was present immediately after cell isolation . The binding affinities of the different T cell preparations for dexamethasone were similar . T cells that are isolated by a combination of nylon wool filtration followed by E-rosette sedimentation bind the same amount of dexamethasone as T cells isolated by nylon wool filtration alone . T cells isolated by a combination of E-rosette sedimentation following by nylon wool filtration bind less dexamethasone than do T cells isolated by E-rosette sedimentation alone . These findings suggest that T cells are heterogeneous with respect to their quantity of glucocorticoid receptors . Isolation of T cells by E-rosette sedimentation enriches for T cells that have a greater number of glucocorticoid receptors , and isolation of T cells by nylon wool filtration enriches for T cells that have a lesser number of glucocorticoid receptors .",gene
"Glucocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid sensitivity of human leukemic cells . We have established optimal conditions for the measurement of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) in human white cells using a whole-cell binding assay with [ 3H ] dexamethasone as the ligand , and the subsequent determination of the GR content in normal human lymphocytes and in leukemic cells of patients with various forms of acute and chronic leukemia . A number of leukemia cell lines in continuous culture were also subjected to the GR assay , and the results were correlated with the sensitivity of these cell lines to glucocorticoid steroids in vitro . The GR content of normal human lymphocytes amounted to 4 , 850 +/- 1 , 340 ( mean +/- SD ) receptors/cell . The mean equilibrium dissociation constant ( KD ) of the interaction of [ 3H ] dexamethasone with the GR was 1.2 x 10 ( -8 ) M . Steroidal compounds with a known glucocorticoid potency effectively competed for the binding , whereas steroids devoid of glucocorticoid activity ( e.g. estradiol-17 beta and testosterone ) were ineffective . The GR content of the blast cells obtained from eight patients suffering from acute leukemia and four patients with a blast crisis of chronic myelocytic leukemia was found to be highly variable ( 3 , 230-29 , 900 receptors/cell ) , while the lymphocytes of six patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia contained a rather stable GR content ( 2 , 930-5 , 120 receptors/cell ) , which was comparable with that of normal lymphocytes . GR was identified in all the 12 malignant continuous white cell lines studied . Large cells contained more GR than the smaller ones . There was no apparent correlation between the GR concentration and the sensitivity of the cells in vitro to glucocorticoids as judged by [ 3H ] thymidine incorporation studies . Distribution of the surface markers in the leukemic cell lines did not relate to the GR concentration . We conclude that the presence of GR is probably a universal feature of the leukemic cells , and , from a clinical standpoint , probably does not alone imply steroid responsiveness .",gene
"Evidence for a steroid receptor in rheumatoid synovial tissue cells . One mechanism by which glucocorticoids could exert their anti-inflammatory action is via rapidly saturable , stereo-specific cytoplasmic protein receptors . This report is of an investigation into such a possibility in synovial cells . Synovium , obtained from knee joints of rheumatoid patients undergoing surgery , was incubated with clostridiopeptidase A and trypsin-EDTA to obtain cell suspensions . These , together with cells obtained from synovial fluid aspirated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis , were identified by electron microscopy . Duplicate samples of these cell suspensions were incubated with increasing concentrations of H3Dexamethasone ( 1 x 10 ( -10 ) M-1 x 10 ( -9 ) M ) for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C . Analysis of the proportion of steroid bound to whole cells showed evidence for specific , rapidly saturable , receptors in the cells obtained from synovial tissue , but this was not found in synovial fluid cells . Electron micrographs showed that cells obtained from synovial tissue consisted of synovial fibroblast - and macrophage-types , lymphocytes , monocytes and macrophages . Polymorphonuclear leucocytes appeared to be absent . However , in synovial fluid cell type polymorphonuclear leucocytes were the predominant cell type . We concluded from this , that one or more of the cell types present in synovial tissue contain a specific steroid receptor , but that this is lacking in synovial fluid polymorphonuclear leucocytes .",gene
"Clinical implications of glucocorticoid receptors in human leukemia . Glucorticoid receptors were studied in various populations of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes and leukemic lymphoblasts . Normal lymphocytes contain low levels of glucocorticoid receptor ( approximately 2 , 500 sites/cell ) which are identical in T- and non-T-fractions . Phytohemagglutinin treatment increases levels about 3-fold . Leukemic lymphoblasts contain larger numbers of receptor sites . Presence of receptor is correlated with in vitro sensitivitiy to glucocorticoids and in vivo response to therapy . Quantity of receptor is also correlated with complete remission duration independently of leukemic cell type ( T or O ) , initial WBC , or age of patient . Quantitative determination of glucocorticoid receptor levels in acute lymphoblastic leukemia may be of value both as an independent prognostic variable and in suggesting which patients should receive glucocorticoid therapy .",gene
"Functional and physical interaction of protein-tyrosine kinases Fyn and Csk in the T-cell signaling system . The Src-like protein-tyrosine kinase Fyn is associated with T-cell antigen receptor . Transient expression of actively mutated Fyn , having Phe-528 instead of Tyr-528 or Thr-338 instead of Ile-338 , in Jurkat T-cells stimulated the serum response element ( SRE ) , 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate response element , cyclic AMP response element , and c-fos promoter . The stimulation of SRE was particularly prominent not only with active Fyn but also with normal ( wild-type ) Fyn . SRE was also stimulated by both normal and active Lck . Furthermore , normal and active Fyn stimulated transcription from the IL-2 gene promoter when transfected cells were stimulated by concanavalin A plus 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate . Under the same conditions , Lck did not stimulate IL-2 promoter unless it was activated by mutation . Interestingly , a mutant Fyn , which has deletions within the SH2 region and so is able to transform chicken embryo fibroblasts , did not stimulate either the c-fos or IL-2 promoter , suggesting the importance of this region in T-cell signaling . Csk , which phosphorylates tyrosine residues in the negative regulatory sites of Src family kinases , down-regulated Fyn- and Lck-mediated stimulation of the serum response element and Fyn-mediated enhancement of IL-2 promoter activity . These data suggest that Fyn and Lck , whose activities are regulated by Csk , are involved in different phases of T-cell activation .",gene
"A novel NF-kappa B complex containing p65 homodimers : implications for transcriptional control at the level of subunit dimerization . The predominant inducible form of the NF-kappa B transcription factor is a heteromeric complex containing two Rel-related DNA-binding subunits , termed p65 and p50 . Prior transfection studies have shown that when these p65 and p50 subunits are expressed independently as stable homodimers , p65 stimulates kappa B-directed transcription , whereas p50 functions as a kappa B-specific repressor . While authentic p50 homodimers ( previously termed KBF1 ) have been detected in nuclear extracts from nontransfected cells , experimental evidence supporting the existence of p65 homodimers in vivo was lacking . We now provide direct biochemical evidence for the presence of an endogenous pool of inducible p65 homodimers in intact human T cells . As with the prototypical NF-kappa B p50-p65 heterodimer , this novel p65 homodimeric form of NF-kappa B is functionally sequestered in the cytoplasm but rapidly appears in the nuclear compartment following cellular stimulation . Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that the homodimerization function of p65 is dependent upon the presence of cysteine 216 and a conserved recognition motif for protein kinase A ( RRPS ; amino acids 273 to 276 ) , both of which reside within a 91-amino-acid segment of the Rel homology domain that mediates self-association . In contrast , mutations at these two sites do not affect heterodimerization of p65 with p50 or its functional interaction with I kappa B alpha . These later findings indicate that neither homo- nor heterodimer formation is an absolute prerequisite for I kappa B alpha recognition of p65 . Taken together with prior in vivo transcription studies , these results suggest that the biological activities of p65 and p50 homodimers are independently regulated , thereby providing an integrated and flexible control mechanism for the rapid activation and repression of NF-kappa B / Rel -directed gene expression .",gene
"Carrier determination for X-linked agammaglobulinemia using X inactivation analysis of purified B cells . We report the development of a relatively quick and simple method for the assessment of X inactivation status for carrier determination in families affected by X-linked agammaglobulinemia ( XLA ) . This method utilises an immunomagnetic separation technique for B cell purification and a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) based assay for the determination of methylation status at the androgen receptor ( AR ) gene locus to assess whether X inactivation is random or non-random at this locus . We report the results we have obtained using this assay to investigate females known to be carriers of various X-linked immunodeficiency disorders . In addition , we investigated four females from different families affected by XLA , two of whom were of unknown carrier status , and we discuss the results obtained with this and other X-inactivation assays . A similar assay has recently been described by Allen et al. ( 1992 ) and applied to members of one family affected by XLA .",gene
"Effects of IL-4 and Fc gamma receptor II engagement on Egr-1 expression during stimulation of B lymphocytes by membrane immunoglobulin crosslinking . Egr-1 is an immediate early gene that is rapidly upregulated in response to mitogenic signals induced by antigen receptor crosslinking on murine B lymphocytes . It has been shown that levels of Egr-1 expression are closely correlated with B cell proliferation in several models of B cell activation and tolerance . We compared the expression of Egr-1 during B cell stimulation with Fab'2 and IgG anti-immunoglobulin ( anti-Ig ) , since it is known that Fab'2 anti-Ig is mitogenic while IgG anti-Ig is not , owing to a dominant inhibitory effect of crosslinking the B cell Fc gamma RII to membrane Ig . While mitogenic doses of Fab'2 anti-Ig induce large and rapid increases in Egr-1 expression , IgG anti-Ig results in smaller increases in Egr-1 mRNA , comparable to that seen with submitogenic concentrations of Fab'2 anti-Ig . However , the correlation between Egr-1 expression and B cell proliferation breaks down when IL-4 is added as a co-mitogen to induce B cell proliferation with IgG anti-Ig or submitogenic concentrations of Fab'2 anti-Ig . No corresponding increases in Egr-1 mRNA levels are observed when IL-4 is added . Therefore , IL-4 overcomes Fc receptor-mediated inhibition of B cell proliferation without affecting inhibition of Egr-1 mRNA induction , as demonstrated earlier for c-myc mRNA in this system .",gene
"Identification of a novel cyclosporin-sensitive element in the human tumor necrosis factor alpha gene promoter . Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , a cytokine with pleiotropic biological effects , is produced by a variety of cell types in response to induction by diverse stimuli . In this paper , TNF-alpha mRNA is shown to be highly induced in a murine T cell clone by stimulation with T cell receptor ( TCR ) ligands or by calcium ionophores alone . Induction is rapid , does not require de novo protein synthesis , and is completely blocked by the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A ( CsA ) . We have identified a human TNF-alpha promoter element , kappa 3 , which plays a key role in the calcium-mediated inducibility and CsA sensitivity of the gene . In electrophoretic mobility shift assays , an oligonucleotide containing kappa 3 forms two DNA protein complexes with proteins that are present in extracts from unstimulated T cells . These complexes appear in nuclear extracts only after T cell stimulation . Induction of the inducible nuclear complexes is rapid , independent of protein synthesis , and blocked by CsA , and thus , exactly parallels the induction of TNF-alpha mRNA by TCR ligands or by calcium ionophore . Our studies indicate that the kappa 3 binding factor resembles the preexisting component of nuclear factor of activated T cells . Thus , the TNF-alpha gene is an immediate early gene in activated T cells and provides a new model system in which to study CsA-sensitive gene induction in activated T cells .",gene
"Differences in expression of transcription factor AP-1 in human promyelocytic HL-60 cells during differentiation towards macrophages versus granulocytes . Commitment of HL-60 cells to macrophage or granulocytic differentiation was achieved by incubation with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) for 30-60 min or with dimethyl sulphoxide ( DMSO ) for 24 h respectively . The commitment stage towards PMA-induced macrophage differentiation was associated with increases in jun B and c-fos mRNA levels , as well as with an increase in the binding activity of transcription factor AP-1 . Nevertheless , gel retardation analysis indicated that the AP-1 activity detected in untreated cells was drastically reduced during the commitment stage of DMSO-induced HL-60 differentiation towards granulocytes . When HL-60 cells were treated with sodium butyrate , which induced monocytic differentiation , a remarkable increase in AP-1 binding activity was detected . Treatment of HL-60 cells with 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 , another monocytic differentiation agent , induced a weak , but appreciable , increase in AP-1 activity . Furthermore , addition of sodium butyrate or 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to HL-60 cells induced the expression of c-fos , c-jun , jun B and jun D proto-oncogenes . In contrast , when HL-60 cells were treated with retinoic acid , a granulocytic differentiation inducer , no enhanced AP-1 binding activity was observed , and only a weak increase in jun D mRNA level was detected . These data indicate that formation of AP-1 is not required for the induction of HL-60 differentiation towards granulocytes , whereas induction of monocytic differentiation is correlated with an increase in AP-1 activity . The differential expression of AP-1 activity may be critical in the differentiation of HL-60 cells towards monocytic or granulocytic lineages",gene
"Glucocorticoid receptors and sensitivity in leukemias . In an attempt to investigate the utility of glucocorticoid receptor determination to predict clinical responsiveness in human leukemias we have studied glucocorticoid receptors in the leukemic cells from 46 patients and in the lymphocytes from 18 normal donors . In the normal lymphocytes there were 3 , 875 ( Median ) specific binding sites per cell . The blasts from 17 patients with ANLL had on average higher levels of binding sites per cell ( Median = 7 , 250 , range : 0 to 15 , 295 ) than the other leukemias . Of the 15 patients with CLL , six had received glucocorticoid treatment for 3 to 5 years . Their lymphocytes had lower number of receptors ( Median = 2 , 000 ) than the other cases which were newly diagnosed ( Median = 4 , 500 ) . Four patients had ALL/AUL , three patients had blast crisis as terminal phase of CML , and seven had leukemic Non-Hodgkin lymphomas ( Median = 3 , 500 sites/cell ) . In 24 patients we have also studied the in vitro sensitivity of the leukemic cells to dexamethasone . There was no marked correlation between glucocorticoid receptor levels and in vitro sensitivity . An attempt to correlate receptor levels with clinical responsiveness demonstrated that glucocorticoid receptor determination might be of value in patients with lymphoid malignancies but probably not in patients with other leukemias .",gene
"'Activation-labile ' glucocorticoid-receptor complexes of a steroid-resistant variant of CEM-C7 human lymphoid cells . For cytoplasmic glucocorticoid-receptor complexes to enter and accumulate in the nucleus a temperature-dependent event , 'activation ' is required . Activation can be achieved in vitro by increased ionic strength , dilution or gel filtration and is manifested by an increased affinity of steroid-receptor complex for DNA and an altered elution profile from ion-exchange resins . Munck and Foley have shown that activated complexes isolated from thymocytes elute from DEAE-cellulose in a manner identical to complexes activated in vitro . We report here that DEAE-cellulose chromatography of steroid-receptor complexes from CEM-C7 , a cloned human leukaemic T-cell line sensitive to the cytolytic action of glucocorticoids , and its steroid-resistant subclone 4R4 demonstrated that steroid receptors of clone 4R4 can not form stable activated complexes .

"Interaction of glucocorticoids with macrophages . Identification of glucocorticoid receptors in monocytes and macrophages . Glucocorticoid binding was measured in resident and thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages , rabbit alveolar macrophages , and human monocytes . Two assays of binding were used -- an assay with intact cells in suspension or monolayers , and an assay of cytosol and nuclear forms of glucocorticoid receptors . The mononuclear phagocytes contained approximately equal to 4 -- 10 X 10 ( 3 ) high affinity receptor sites per cell , with dissociation constants of approximately equal to 2 -- 8 nM dexamethasone . The binding to the saturable sites was specific for steroids with glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid activity . Cortisol , corticosterone , and progesterone competed with dexamethasone for binding , whereas estradiol , dihydrotestosterone , and 11-epicortisol competed very little . Binding of dexamethasone to cytosol and nuclear forms of the receptor complex and temperature-sensitive translocation of cytosol forms to nuclear forms were shown . At 37 degrees C the predominant form of the hormone-receptor complex was nuclear . These results demonstrate that corticosteroids interact with macrophages at physiological concentrations .",gene
"Nitric oxide signaling : a possible role for G proteins . We have previously reported various inductive effects of nitric oxide on human PBMC . We describe a novel and potentially important mechanism of nitric oxide signaling-through direct activation of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins ( G proteins ) . We have found that nitric oxide treatment of membranes isolated from fresh human PBMC enhances the ability of these membranes to hydrolyze [ gamma-32P ] GTP and bind [ gamma-35S ] GTP . In addition , treatment of whole cells with nitric oxide yielded membranes with enhanced GTPase activity . Furthermore , the GTPase activity of pure , recombinant Gs alpha , Gi alpha 1 , and p21ras was greatly enhanced by nitric oxide . In support of the existence of this pathway in whole cells , we found that the G protein inhibitor , GDP-beta-S , blocked NF-kappa B translocation induced by nitric oxide or LPS in permeabilized cells . In addition , nitric oxide greatly reduced the pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of 45- and 41-kDa proteins in membranes of these cells . Because G proteins play a central role in many diverse signaling systems , activation by an endogenous and inducible oxidant may represent a novel signaling pathway .",gene
"The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor promoter cis-acting element CLE0 mediates induction signals in T cells and is recognized by factors related to AP1 and NFAT . Expression of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene in T cells is activated by the combination of phorbol ester ( phorbol myristate acetate ) and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) , which mimic antigen stimulation through the T-cell receptor . We have previously shown that a fragment containing bp -95 to +27 of the mouse GM-CSF promoter can confer inducibility to reporter genes in the human Jurkat T-cell line . Here we use an in vitro transcription system to demonstrate that a cis-acting element ( positions -54 to -40 ) , referred to as CLE0 , is a target for the induction signals . We observed induction with templates containing intact CLE0 but not with templates with deleted or mutated CLE0 . We also observed that two distinct signals were required for the stimulation through CLE0 , since only extracts from cells treated with both phorbol myristate acetate and A23187 supported optimal induction . Stimulation probably was mediated by CLE0-binding proteins because depletion of these proteins specifically reduced GM-CSF transcription . One of the binding factors possessed biochemical and immunological features identical to those of the transcription factor AP1 . Another factor resembled the T-cell-specific factor NFAT . The characteristics of these two factors are consistent with their involvement in GM-CSF induction . The presence of CLE0-like elements in the promoters of interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) , IL-4 , IL-5 , GM-CSF , and NFAT sites in the IL-2 promoter suggests that the factors we detected , or related factors that recognize these sites , may account for the coordinate induction of these genes during T-cell activation .",gene

Expression of the human CD8 alpha gene is restricted to cells of the lymphoid lineage and developmentally regulated during thymopoiesis . As an initial step towards understanding the molecular basis for tissue-specific expression of this gene , we surveyed the surrounding chromatin structure for potential cis-acting regulatory regions by DNase I hypersensitivity mapping and found four hypersensitive sites , three of which were T cell restricted . By using a reporter-based expression approach , a T-cell-specific enhancer was identified by its close association with a prominent T-cell-restricted hypersensitive sites in the last intron of the CD8 alpha gene . Deletion studies demonstrated that the minimal enhancer is adjacent to a negative regulatory element . DNA sequence analysis of the minimal enhancer revealed a striking cluster of consensus binding sites for Ets-1 , TCF-1 , CRE , GATA-3 , LyF-1 , and bHLH proteins which were verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays . In addition , the 5 ' end of the enhancer was composed of an Alu repeat which contained the GATA-3 , bHLH , and LyF-1 binding sites . Site-directed mutation of the Ets-1 and GATA-3 sites dramatically reduced enhancer activity . The functional importance of the other binding sites only became apparent when combinations of mutations were analyzed . Taken together , these results suggest that the human CD8 alpha gene is regulated by the interaction of multiple T-cell nuclear proteins with a transcriptional enhancer located in the last intron of the gene . Comparison of the CD8 alpha enhancer with other recently identified T-cell-specific regulatory elements suggests that a common set of transcription factors regulates several T-cell genes .",gene
"Molecular regulation of the human IL-3 gene : inducible T cell-restricted expression requires intact AP-1 and Elf-1 nuclear protein binding sites . Interleukin 3 ( IL-3 ) is a hematopoietic stem-cell growth and differentiation factor that is expressed solely in activated T and NK cells . Studies to date have identified elements 5 ' to the IL-3 coding sequences that regulate its transcription , but the sequences that confer T cell-specific expression remain to be clearly defined . We have now identified DNA sequences that are required for T cell-restricted IL-3 gene transcription . A series of transient transfections performed with human IL-3-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter plasmids in T and non-T cells revealed that a plasmid containing 319 bp of 5 ' flanking sequences was active exclusively in T cells . Deletion analysis revealed that T cell specificity was conferred by a 49-bp fragment ( bp -319 to -270 ) that included a potential binding site for AP-1 transcription factors 6 bp upstream of a binding site for Elf-1 , a member of the Ets family of transcription factors . DNaseI footprint and electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses performed with MLA-144 T cell nuclear extracts demonstrated that this 49-bp region contains a nuclear protein binding region that includes consensus AP-1 and Elf-1 binding sites . In addition , extracts prepared from purified human T cells contained proteins that bound to synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the AP-1 and Elf-1 binding sites . In vitro-transcribed and -translated Elf-1 protein bound specifically to the Elf-1 site , and Elf-1 antisera competed and super shifted nuclear protein complexes present in MLA-144 nuclear extracts . Moreover , addition of anti-Jun family antiserum in electrophoretic mobility shift assay reactions completely blocked formation of the AP-1-related complexes . Transient transfection studies in MLA-144 T cells revealed that constructs containing mutations in the AP-1 site almost completely abolished CAT activity while mutation of the Elf-1 site or the NF-IL-3 site , a previously described nuclear protein binding site ( bp. -155 to -148 ) in the IL-3 promoter , reduced",gene
"CAT activity to < 25 % of the activity given by wild-type constructs . We conclude that expression of the human IL-3 gene requires the AP-1 and Elf-1 binding sites ; however , unlike other previously characterized cytokine genes such as IL-2 , the AP-1 and Elf-1 factors can bind independently in the IL-3 gene .

"Combination IL-2 and IL-4 reduces glucocorticoid receptor-binding affinity and T cell response to glucocorticoids . The mechanisms contributing to persistent T cell activation and poor response to glucocorticoids in chronic inflammatory illnesses such as steroid resistant ( SR ) asthma are poorly defined . We examined the possibility that certain cytokines , specifically IL-2 and IL-4 , could affect T cell response to glucocorticoids . A [ 3H ] dexamethasone radioligand-binding assay was used to measure the number of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) and dissociation constant ( Kd ) in PBMC from normal donors and patients with SR asthma , cultured in the absence and presence of these cytokines . PBMC from normal donors incubated for 48 h in the presence of combination IL-2 + IL-4 had nuclear GR with significantly reduced binding affinity ( GR Kd = 36.1 +/- 1.63 nM , mean +/- SEM ; p = 0.0001 ) as compared with PBMC incubated with medium alone ( GR Kd = 6.74 +/- 0.46 nM ) . The cytosolic GR Kd remained unchanged . However , when PBMC were incubated with IL-2 alone or IL-4 alone , no change in GR-binding affinity was observed . Furthermore , when T cells and non-T cells were individually stimulated with combination IL-2 + IL-4 , a significant reduction in GR-binding affinity was observed only in the T cell population ( p = 0.0001 ) . The IL-2 + IL-4-induced alteration in PBMC GR Kd was associated with an increase in GR number ( 8348 +/- 964 vs 1710 +/- 228 sites/cell ; p = 0.0003 ) . More importantly , the alteration in PBMC GR-binding affinity with IL-2 + IL-4 was associated with a functional change in T cell response to methylprednisolone MPN , i.e. , a reduced inhibitory effect of MPN on PMA/ionomycin-induced T cell proliferation . These effects of IL-2 + IL-4 on PBMC",gene
"GR affinity and response to MPN were blocked by co-incubation with IFN-gamma . Freshly isolated PBMC from four patients with SR asthma had a significantly reduced GR-binding affinity ( Kd = 40.0 +/- 2.68 nM ; p = 0.0001 ) when compared with seven normal subjects ( 7.15 +/- 0.41 nM ) . The altered PBMC GR binding from patients with SR asthma reversed to normal when incubated with medium alone , but was sustained with IL-2 + IL-4 . These observations suggest that with persistent inflammation certain cytokines may contribute to an impaired response to glucocorticoids . Furthermore , the effects of IL-2 and IL-4 were blocked by IFN-gamma .",gene
"Characterization of the human CD4 gene promoter : transcription from the CD4 gene core promoter is tissue-specific and is activated by Ets proteins . We analyzed the 5 ' transcription control sequences of the human CD4 gene . We located the transcription initiation site and showed that the CD4 core promoter ( positions -40 to +16 ) lacks a classical `` TATA '' or initiator positioning consensus sequence but directs precise and efficient transcription when coupled to the ubiquitously active simian virus 40 enhancer . The transcriptional activity of the CD4 gene promoter correlated with CD4 expression in various cell types . Interestingly , the CD4 core promoter also displayed a tissue-specific transcriptional activity . Within this fragment , three nucleic acid sequences are completely conserved in the murine CD4 gene . One of these sequences contains a perfect ETS consensus sequence . Another ETS consensus sequence is located 1060 nt upstream . Electrophoretic-mobility-shift assays showed that the core promoter ETS motif binds an Ets-related protein specifically expressed at high levels in CD4+ cells . Moreover , in CD4- cells , overexpression of Ets-1 or Ets-2 efficiently and specifically activated transcription from the CD4 promoter and core promoter . These data indicate that Ets transcription factors play a central role in controlling CD4 gene expression , by binding to both a classical remote site and an unusual proximal activator sequence",gene
"Glucocorticoid receptor activation and inactivation in c ultured human lymphocytes . Although glucocorticoids are not cytolytic for and do not inhibit the growth of the IM-9 line of cultured human lymphoblasts , these cells have a high steroid-binding capacity . We have used IM-9 cells in order to examine whether unoccupied glucocorticoid receptors are inactivated and activated in intact cells . when IM-9 cells are incubated in glucose-free medium in a nitrogen atmosphere , both their ability to bind triamcinolone acetonide and their ATP levels decline and , when glucose and oxygen are reintroduced , ATP levels and receptor activity return . The specific glucocorticoid-binding activity of cytosol prepared from cells exposed to various degrees of energy limitation is directly correlated with the ATP content . Receptor activation in intact cells is rapid and independent of protein synthesis . Cytosol prepared from inactivated cells can not be activated by addition of ATP . The inactivation of glucocorticoid receptors that occurs when cytosol from normal IM-9 cells is incubated at 25 degrees C is inhibited by molybdate , vanadate , fluoride , ATP , and several other nucleotides . The experiments with intact human lymphoblasts suggest that assays of specific glucocorticoid-binding capacity do not necessarily reflect the cellular content of receptor protein .",gene
"Glucocorticoids and lymphocytes . II . Cell cycle-dependent changes in glucocorticoid receptor content . To study variations in glucocorticoid receptor levels during the cell cycle , we have separated mitogen-stimulated human peripheral lymphocytes and rat lymph node cells by unit gravity sedimentation and measured glucocorticoid binding in the resultant fractions . By morphologic criteria and thymidine incorporation , the fractions were separated into populations of G0 and G1 phase and S and post-S phase cells . A 2- to 3-fold increase in glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell , for cells in the S and post-S phase over those in G0 and G1 , was observed with both nonstimulated rat lymph node cell suspensions and concanavalin A-stimulated human peripheral lymphocytes . These observations together with those from other studies indicate that formation of new glucocorticoid receptors near the S phase may be a general phenomenon in proliferating cells . We propose that this increase in glucocorticoid receptors during the cell cycle may explain the increase in glucocorticoid receptors in mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes .",gene
"The leukocyte migration inhibition response to certain breast cancer-related antigens ( MCF-7 and MuMTV ) : their potential as discriminants . Certain oncogenic viruses have been implicated in human breast cancer , including the murine mammary tumor virus ( MuMTV ) and the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus ( MPMV ) . We have used the leukocyte migration inhibition ( LMI ) response to assay the response to several potential breast cancer-related antigens , including MuMTV , MPMV , and a breast cancer cultured cell line , MCF-7 , in 96 breast cancer patients , in 32 women with benign breast disease , and in 67 normal women . The lowest tenth percentile of control ( LMI ) responses was used as the cutoff point to designate responders . Breast cancer patients showed significant responses to MuMTV ( 49 % and to MCF-7 ( 50 % ) , but not to MPMV ( 29 % ) . In a paired-antigen study using MuMTV and MCF-7 , 75 % of the breast cancer patients responded , versus 18 % of the normal women ( P less than 0.0050 ) . The potential for this assay to distinguish `` normal '' from `` breast cancer '' was analyzed using a migration index derived from discriminant analysis . The ability of the assay to discriminate `` normal '' from `` cancer '' was significant ( P less than 0.001 ) and showed a sensitivity of detecting `` cancer '' of 75 % . The overall responses to MuMTV and MCF-7 were analyzed with reference to certain prognostic factors , but showed no relation to age , menstrual status , estrogen receptor status , or stage of disease . The above reactions suggest that a large proportion of breast cancer patients exhibit presensitization to antigenfs found in MuMTV and MCF-7 , which may be cross-reactive with antigens in the primary cancer . These responses appear to be independent of major prognostic variables . Further refinement of this assay may yield one which is more highly discriminating for breast cancer .",gene

"Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate inhibits NF-kappa B mobilization and TNF production in human monocytes . The human TNF promoter contains four potential nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) -binding sites , with the strongest binding seen for the -605 motif . Nuclear extracts from unstimulated cells of the human monocytic cell line , Mono Mac 6 , contain one specific binding protein ( complex II ) , consistent with a constitutive p50 homodimer . Stimulation of Mono Mac 6 cells with LPS will increase complex II and will strongly induce a second specific complex ( complex I ) , which represents the p50/65 heterodimer . Treatment of Mono Mac 6 cells with pyrrolidine-dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) at 300 microM will block the LPS-induced complex I almost completely and will reduce complex II to the constitutive level . Binding activity of other nuclear factors that recognize the SP-1 and c/EBP motifs of the human TNF promoter is not affected by such treatment . Northern blot analysis demonstrates that PDTC treatment will strongly reduce LPS-induced TNF transcripts . Secreted TNF protein as detected in the Wehi 164S/ActD bioassay and in a sandwich immunoassay was similarly reduced by PDTC . Kinetic analyses show that after LPS stimulation , NF-kappa B will peak at 1 h , TNF transcript prevalence at 2 h , and TNF protein at 4 h . PDTC did not shift this response to LPS to a later time , but suppressed NF-kappa B mobilization , TNF transcripts , and TNF protein over the entire 8-h observation period . Analysis of freshly isolated , LPS-stimulated blood monocytes showed a similar blockade of NF-kappa B . Furthermore , in these primary cells , induction of TNF transcripts , as determined by Northern blot analysis and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction , was prevented by PDTC as was TNF protein production . These data show that dithiocarbamates can profoundly affect cytokine expression and suggest that NF-kappa B is involved in LPS-induced TNF gene expression in human monocytes .",gene
"Comparing regions of the Epstein-Barr virus ZEBRA protein which function as transcriptional activating sequences in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in B cells . The ZEBRA protein activates expression of Epstein-Barr virus early-lytic-cycle genes in human B lymphocytes . Here it is shown that ZEBRA also behaves as a sequence-specific transcriptional activator in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Deletional mutagenesis defined three regions of ZEBRA that participate in activation in S. cerevisiae . These regions are designated YI ( amino acids [ aa ] 1 to 25 ) , YII ( aa 51 to 102 ) , and YIII ( aa 228 to 245 ) . Two of the three regions of the native ZEBRA protein act together to mediate activation when assayed on ZEBRA binding sites . However , when fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL 4 and assayed on GAL4 binding sites , regions YII and YIII were each sufficient to confer activation in S. cerevisiae . Regions of ZEBRA which affected activation in S. cerevisiae were also required in human B lymphocytes . The amino-terminal region of ZEBRA ( aa 1 to 98 ) was required for activation both in S. cerevisiae and in human B cells ; deletion of the carboxy-terminal 18 aa also significantly reduced activation in both cell types . Thus , the behavior of ZEBRA in human B cells and S. cerevisiae suggests that the protein contains universal activation motifs that interact with conserved components of the transcription machinery . However , certain deletion mutants of ZEBRA containing mutations in the N-terminal region exhibited discordant behaviors in S. cerevisiae and in B cells . For example , deletion of ZEBRA aa 26 to 51 impaired activation to a great extent in B cells but had little or no effect in S. cerevisiae . The discordant mutants may reflect interactions with a variable domain of a conserved component or unique interactions with specialized components of the basal transcription apparatus in different cells .",gene
"Functional interaction of the v-Rel and c-Rel oncoproteins with the TATA-binding protein and association with transcription factor IIB . Rel family proteins regulate the expression of genes linked to kappa B-binding motifs . Little is known , however , of the mechanism by which they enhance transcription . We have investigated the ability of the v-Rel and c-Rel oncoproteins to interact with components of the basal transcription machinery . Here we report that both the acidic transcription activation domain mapping to the unique C terminus of chicken c-Rel and the F9 cell-specific activation region common to both v-Rel and c-Rel interact with the TATA-binding protein ( TBP ) and transcription factor IIB ( TFIIB ) in vitro and in vivo . We also demonstrate that TPB interaction with Rel activation regions leads to synergistic activation of transcription of a kappa B-linked reporter gene . Combined with the observation that the mouse c-Rel and human RelA proteins also interact with TBP and TFIIB in vitro , these results suggest that association with basal transcription factors is important for the transcriptional activities of Rel family proteins .",gene
"p21ras and calcineurin synergize to regulate the nuclear factor of activated T cells . In T lymphocytes , triggering of the T cell receptor ( TCR ) induces several signaling cascades which ultimately synergize to induce the activity of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , a DNA binding complex critical to the inducibility and T cell specificity of the T cell growth factor interleukin 2 . One immediate consequence of T cell activation via the TCR is an increase in cytosolic calcium . Calcium signals are important for NFAT induction , and recent studies have identified calcineurin , a calcium-calmodulin dependent serine-threonine phosphatase , as a prominent component of the calcium signaling pathway in T cells . A second important molecule in TCR signal transduction is the guanine nucleotide binding protein , p21ras , which is coupled to the TCR by a protein tyrosine kinase dependent mechanism . The experiments presented here show that expression by transfection of mutationally activated calcineurin or activated p21ras alone is insufficient for NFAT transactivation . However , coexpression of the activated calcineurin with activated p21ras could mimic TCR signals in NFAT induction . These data identify calcineurin and p21ras as cooperative partners in T cell activation .",gene
"Expression of the chicken GATA factor family during early erythroid development and differentiation . The DNA motif WGATAR has been identified within transcriptional regulatory domains of globin and other erythroid-specific genes and the activator proteins that bind to this regulatory element , the GATA factors , belong to a multi-gene family that is expressed in chicken erythroid cells . Here we show that , as in chickens , multiple members of the GATA factor family are expressed in human and murine erythroid cells . During the early stages of chicken embryogenesis ( well before blood island formation ) , each of the GATA family members is transcribed with a unique temporal and spatial pattern . In the primitive erythroid lineage , transcription of the embryonic epsilon-globin gene parallels GATA-1 expression while the switch to beta-globin transcription in definitive erythroid cells is directly preceded by a pronounced increase in GATA-3 accumulation . The timing and pattern of expression of these different mRNAs during avian erythroid development and differentiation suggests that temporally regulated changes in GATA factor expression are required for vertebrate hematopoiesis .",gene
"Molecular regulation of human interleukin 2 and T-cell function by interleukin 4 . Distinct functional T-cell subsets , differing in the patterns of lymphokines produced , regulate cell-mediated and humoral immune responses . The two major types and their principal products , interleukin 4 and interferon gamma ( IL-4 and IFN-gamma ) , are reciprocally negatively interactive . To analyze the molecular mechanism of IL-4-mediated suppression of cell-mediated immunity we studied its effects on expression of interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) and IFN-gamma . IL-4 pretreatment of Jurkat cells prior to stimulation resulted in a decrease in transcription of the IL2 gene . IL-4 suppressed IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA levels in primary human T cells , and addition of anti-CD28 antibodies relieved this suppression . Using enhancer-reporter constructs , IL-4 specifically down-regulated the NFIL-2B element . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a DNA oligomer containing the NFIL-2B binding site indicated that IL-4 inhibited the NFIL-2B complex and that the NFIL-2B DNA binding factor is distinct from AP- 1 . These results suggest that IL-4 may regulate development and function of T-cell subsets involved in cell-mediated immunity in part by inhibiting factors required for transcription of the IL2 gene",gene
"Immunochemical differences between glucocorticoid receptors from corticoid-sensitive and -resistant malignant lymphocytes . We have explored the possibility of using antibodies against purified rat liver glucocorticoid receptors to study the immunochemical properties of glucocorticoid receptors from murine and human malignant lymphocytes . For this purpose , purified immune immunoglobulin G was covalently linked to Sepharose CL-4B . We then examined the ability of the affinity gel to recognize cytosolic [ 3H ] triamcinolone acetonide-receptor complexes from the corticoid-sensitive ( CS ) and -resistant strains of mouse lymphoma P1798 , from CS lymphocytes of patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia , and from a CS clone of human leukemic lymphoblasts in tissue culture ( CH6 ) . Mouse thymus was used as a source of glucocorticoid receptor from normal CS lymphocytes . Whereas the immunoaffinity column retained 70 to 84 % of the 58- to 62-A ( Stokes radius ) [ 3H ] triamcinolone acetonide-receptor complexes characteristic of the CS mouse and human lymphocytes , it failed to recognize the 27- to 28-A ( Stokes radius ) glucocorticoid receptor present in corticoid-resistant mouse lymphoma P1798 cells . Therefore , under appropriate experimental conditions , it was possible to demonstrate cross-reactivity between the antiserum against rat liver glucocorticoid receptor and the 58- to 62-A ( Stokes radius ) glucocorticoid receptor from species as diverse as mouse and humans .",gene
"Heterogeneity of the in vitro responses to glucocorticoids in acute leukemia . In leukocyte population freshly isolated from the blood of 26 patients with acute leukemia , we have measured several parameters including glucocorticoid receptors , nucleoside incorporation , percentage of cells in S phase , and steroid-induced cell lysis . In addition , in some cases , the short-term response to steroid therapy was determined . Although , in all the patients studied , leukocytes were found to contain glucocorticoid receptors , we failed to demonstrate any correlation between the level of binding sites and the in vitro or in vivo response to glucocorticoids . This absence of correlation could be in part explained by the marked heterogeneity of the steroid response demonstrated in leukocyte subpopulations . It appears , however , that the degree of steroid action in vitro as well as the extent of spontaneous and dexamethasone-induced cell death may be related to the number of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle .",gene
Glucocorticoid receptors in cytosol and nuclear extract of human leukocytes . Cortisol binding by cytosol and 0.4 M KCl extract of the nuclear fraction of human leukocytes were studied by gel chromatography and ion exchange filtration on DEAE cellulose .

"Protein tyrosine kinase activation is required for lipopolysaccharide induction of cytokines in human blood monocytes . Bacterial LPS induce production of cytokines such as IL-1 , IL-6 , and TNF in mononuclear phagocytes , and this represents a central component in the pathogenesis of septic shock syndrome . However , the mechanisms by which LPS activates these cells to express cytokines are not completely characterized . The present study addressed the role of different protein kinases in the LPS induction of cytokines . It is shown that LPS induced a 12- to 16-fold increase in IL-1 beta , IL-6 , and TNF-alpha mRNA levels , and this was completely or more than 80 % blocked by the protein tyrosine kinase specific inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein at the concentrations of 1.7 and 37 microM , respectively . Protein kinase C inhibition by staurosporine reduced LPS induction of TNF-alpha , whereas it had no effects on IL-6 and IL-1 beta . Inhibition of protein kinase A by H89 reduced IL-6 mRNA levels but did not detectably change IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha mRNA levels . In contrast , LPS did not increase leukemia inhibitory factor mRNA , which was constitutively expressed and not significantly reduced by these inhibitors . In addition to cytokine mRNA levels , LPS-induced IL-6 protein synthesis and IL-6 bioactivity were also reduced to baseline levels by the PTK inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein . Both PTK inhibitors also reduced the LPS activation of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) , which is a transcription factor involved in the expression of cytokine genes such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha . The activation of NF-kappa B was also reduced by H89 , whereas staurosporine had no effect on this response . In summary , these findings suggest that protein kinase C and protein kinase A appear to have selective effects in the LPS induction of cytokines , whereas PTK is required for LPS induction of a broad spectrum of cytokines and NF-kappa B activation in monocytes .",gene
"In vivo control of NF-kappa B activation by I kappa B alpha . The transcription factor NF-kappa B is stored in the cytoplasm in complexes with the inhibitor protein I kappa B alpha . It has been shown in vitro that dissociation of I kappa B alpha from these complexes results in active NF-kappa B . In this report we show that lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced activation of B or pre-B cells results in loss of I kappa B alpha from NF-kappa B complexes in vivo . Many liberated NF-kappa B dimers reached the nucleus , where increased c-rel , p65 and p50 were detected by immunoblotting and by DNA binding assays . Some liberated dimers were retained in the cytoplasm , however , through binding to newly synthesized I kappa B alpha , a finding which strongly suggests ( i ) that the LPS-induced signal causes dissociation of complexes rather than preventing their association and ( ii ) that dissociation results from modification of I kappa B alpha and not of c-rel or p65 . No effect of LPS treatment was detected on p105 or p100 , which also retain rel family members in the cytoplasm . Quite unexpectedly , we also found that in unstimulated cells there is a constant ongoing process of degradation and replacement of complexed I kappa B alpha . We propose that this turnover results in the low level of active NF-kappa B presumably necessary even in the unstimulated cell , and that the high rate of synthesis of I kappa B alpha provides the ability to turn off NF-kappa B activity rapidly as soon as the activating signal ceases .",gene
"Identification of a killer cell-specific regulatory element of the mouse perforin gene : an Ets-binding site-homologous motif that interacts with Ets-related proteins . The gene encoding the cytolytic protein perforin is selectively expressed by activated killer lymphocytes . To understand the mechanisms underlying the cell-type-specific expression of this gene , we have characterized the regulatory functions and the DNA-protein interactions of the 5'-flanking region of the mouse perforin gene ( Pfp ) . A region extending from residues +62 through -141 , which possesses the essential promoter activity , and regions further upstream , which are able to either enhance or suppress gene expression , were identified . The region between residues -411 and -566 was chosen for further characterization , since it contains an enhancer-like activity . We have identified a 32-mer sequence ( residues -491 to -522 ) which appeared to be capable of enhancing gene expression in a killer cell-specific manner . Within this segment , a 9-mer motif ( 5'-ACAGGAAGT-3 ' , residues -505 to -497 ; designated NF-P motif ) , which is highly homologous to the Ets proto-oncoprotein-binding site , was found to interact with two proteins , NF-P1 and NF-P2 . NF-P2 appears to be induced by reagents known to up-regulate the perforin message level and is present exclusively in killer cells . Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and UV cross-linking experiments revealed that NF-P1 and NF-P2 may possess common DNA-binding subunits . However , the larger native molecular mass of NF-P1 suggests that NF-P1 contains an additional non-DNA-binding subunit ( s ) . In view of the homology between the NF-P motif and other Ets proto-oncoprotein-binding sites , it is postulated that NF-P1 and NF-P2 belong to the Ets protein family . Results obtained from the binding competition assay , nevertheless , suggest that NF-P1 and NF-P2 are related to but distinct from Ets proteins , e.g. , Ets-1 , Ets-2 , and",gene

"The role of NF-kappa B1 ( p50/p105 ) gene expression in activation of human blood T-lymphocytes via CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules . Stimulation of primary human T-lymphocytes via CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules induces a long-lasting proliferation ( > 3 weeks ) . This potent activation does not require accessory cells , such as monocytes , but depends on persistent interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) secretion and receptivity , which is associated with high and prolonged expression of the inducible CD25/IL-2 receptor alpha ( IL-2R alpha ) chain gene . The transcription factor NF-kappa B participates in the regulation of both IL-2 and IL-2R alpha genes , as well as multiple cellular genes involved in T-cell proliferation . To evaluate the role of NF-kappa B in human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes , we previously analyzed the activation of NF-kappa B-related complexes in response to CD2+CD28 costimulation . We demonstrated a long-term induction of p50/p65 heterodimer , a putative p65/c-Rel heterodimer , and a constitutive nuclear expression of KBF1/p50 homodimers . As the role of p50 remains unclear , we focused our present study on NF-kappa B1 ( p50/p105 ) gene regulation . Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Western and Northern blot analyses , we studied NF-kappa B1 gene expression during T-cell stimulation via CD2+CD28 . We observed a transient 4- to 5-fold increase of NF-kappa B1 gene expression at both the mRNA and protein levels , lasting for at least 24 h . p50 DNA-binding activity apparently stays highly controlled when p105 expression is enhanced by a physiological stimulus of peripheral blood T-cells . Partial inhibition of p50 and p105 expression by NF-kappa B1 antisense oligonucleotides significantly reduced T-cell proliferation and CD25/IL-2R alpha cell surface expression .

"Vitamin D receptor quantitation in human blood mononuclear cells in health and disease . Vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) concentration was quantitated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from patients with absorptive hypercalciuria ( AH ) and patients with high 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 due to acquired or transient disease states and the results compared to those in normal subjects . VDR concentration in resting cells was not different between the three groups and represented constitutive receptor expression of monocytes . Following activation with phytohemagglutinin , patients with hypercalcitriolemia demonstrated significantly greater VDR concentrations . Patients with AH demonstrated a normal value for the group , but 6 patients had significantly greater concentrations of VDR despite normal plasma 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 in four of the patients . Proliferation , as assessed from [ 3H ] thymidine incorporation was inversely correlated with serum 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 and was significant ( R = -0.299 , p = 0.048 ) . Taken together , the results suggest that PBMC provide a useful system for studying VDR status in transient or acquired states of hypercalcitriolemia . Furthermore , the studies in patients with absorptive hypercalciuria disclosed it to be a heterogeneous disorder , characterized by both vitamin D-dependent and D-independent forms of receptor up-regulation .",gene
"Reactive oxygen intermediates activate NF-kappa B in a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism and in combination with vanadate activate the p56lck and p59fyn tyrosine kinases in human lymphocytes . We have previously observed that ionizing radiation induces tyrosine phosphorylation in human B-lymphocyte precursors by stimulation of unidentified tyrosine kinases and this phosphorylation is substantially augmented by vanadate . Ionizing radiation generates reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) . Because H2O2 is a potent ROI generator that readily crosses the plasma membrane , we used H2O2 to examine the effects of ROI on signal transduction . We now provide evidence that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A and the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine inhibit both radiation-induced and H2O2-induced activation of NF-kappa B , indicating that activation triggered by ROI is dependent on tyrosine kinase activity . H2O2 was found to stimulate Ins-1 , 4 , 5-P3 production in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner and to induce calcium signals that were greatly augmented by vanadate . The synergistic induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by H2O2 plus vanadate included physiologically relevant proteins such as PLC gamma 1 . Although treatment of cells with H2O2 alone did not affect the activity of src family kinases , treatment with H2O2 plus vanadate led to activation of the p56lck and p59fyn tyrosine kinases . The combined inhibition of phosphatases and activation of kinases provides a potent mechanism for the synergistic effects of H2O2 plus vanadate . Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by ROI may thus lead to many of the pleiotropic effects of ROI in lymphoid cells , including downstream activation of PLC gamma 1 and NF-kappa B",gene
"Influence of sex hormone binding globulin and serum albumin on the conversion of androstenedione to testosterone by human erythrocytes . The influence of human serum albumin and sex hormone binding globulin ( SHBG ) on the enzymic conversion of androstenedione to testosterone in human erythrocytes was investigated in vitro . Total plasma and albumin delayed the conversion rate of androstenedione , while SHBG increased it markedly . The effect of SHBG was largely abolished by heating to 60 degrees C for 1 h and by saturating its binding sites by DHT . The effect of both proteins was found to be related to their concentration . It appears that the binding sites of albumin provide a mechanism for retarding androstenedione uptake by the erythrocytes and that the high binding affinity of SHBG for testosterone facilitates the diffusion of this steroid out of the cell and thus , displaces the chemical equilibrium within the cell .",gene
"Glucocorticoids and lymphocytes . I . Increased glucocorticoid receptor levels in antigen-stimulated lymphocytes . Recently a 2- to 3-fold increase in the number of glucocorticoid receptors in human peripheral lymphocytes has been noted after in vitro mitogen stimulation . Here , we extend these observations to in vivo immunization . After unilateral immunization of adrenalectomized male rats , a 50 % increase in glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell , determined by binding of dexamethasone , was observed in cell suspensions of homolateral lymph nodes over those from the contralateral nonimmunized side of the same animal . The association constant for dexamethasone was similar in both groups , as was the stereospecificity for various steroids , the time course of cytoplasmic and nuclear association , and cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation . Despite a 50 % increase in the number of glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell , the cells from the homolateral and controlateral lymph nodes were equally sensitive to the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone , as determined by measurements of the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors of protein , RNA , and DNA , or measurements of in vitro cell survival .",gene
"Glucocorticoid receptors and actions in rat thymocytes and immunologically stimulated human peripheral lymphocytes . After reviewing briefly our earlier studies on glucocorticoid receptors and mechanisms in thymus cells , we have outlined results from the following two areas of current interest in our laboratories : the `` life-cycle '' of glucocorticoid receptors and complexes in thymus cells , and the levels of glucocorticoid receptors and sensitivity in immunologically stimulated human peripheral lymphocytes . Several of our results on energetics and kinetics of hormone binding to glucocorticoid receptors in rat thymus cells seem to require extension of the simplest model of hormone-receptor transformations in intact cells . ATP-depletion experiments suggest the existence of a nonbinding form of the receptor ; `` chase '' experiments suggest reaction of hormone directly with nuclear-bound receptor ; experiments on depletion and replenishment of cytoplasmic receptor using cortisol and dexamethasone suggest the existence of at least two subpopulations of nuclear-bound hormone-receptor complex . We have found that mitogen or immunologic stimulation of human peripheral lymphocytes in culture leads within 24 h or so to a striking increase in the number of glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell . We believe this increase may be due to partial synchronization of the cell population in a phase of the cell cycle in which receptor content is high . Contrary to the widely held view that mitogen-stimulated cells become insensitive to glucocorticoids , our experiments show that with respect to inhibition of thymidine and uridine incorporation and glucose uptake , the cells are highly sensitive to dexamethasone at 24 , 48 , and 72 h after stimulation with concanavalin A .",gene
"Nuclear glucocorticoid binding in chronic lymphatic leukemia lymphocytes . A reliable procedure is described for isolating 3H-triamcinolone acetonide ( 3H-TA ) receptor complexes from purified chronic lymphatic leukemia ( CLL ) lymphocyte nuclei , based on the use of carbobenzoxy-L-phenylalanine ( CBZ-L-phe ) to prevent breakdown of hormone-receptor complexes during extraction of nuclei with 0.6M KCl . Using this method , specific nuclear glucocorticoid binding was demonstrated in 14/14 patients with untreated CLL . No correlation was found between levels of nuclear-associated 3H-TA and peripheral white blood cell count or rosetting ability of circulating lymphocytes .",gene
"Multiple closely-linked NFAT/octamer and HMG I ( Y ) binding sites are part of the interleukin-4 promoter . We show here that the immediate upstream region ( from position -12 to -270 ) of the murine interleukin 4 ( Il-4 ) gene harbors a strong cell-type specific transcriptional enhancer . In T lymphoma cells , the activity of the Il-4 promoter/enhancer is stimulated by phorbol esters , Ca++ ionophores and agonists of protein kinase A and inhibited by low doses of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A . The Il-4 promoter/enhancer is transcriptionally inactive in B lymphoma cells and HeLa cells . DNase I footprint protection experiments revealed six sites of the Il-4 promoter/enhancer to be bound by nuclear proteins from lymphoid and myeloid cells . Among them are four purine boxes which have been described to be important sequence motifs of the Il-2 promoter . They contain the motif GGAAA and are recognized by the inducible and cyclosporin A-sensitive transcription factor NFAT-1 . Three of the Il-4 NFAT-1 sites are closely linked to weak binding sites of Octamer factors . Several purine boxes and an AT-rich protein-binding site of the Il-4 promoter are also recognized by the high mobility group protein HMG I ( Y ) . Whereas the binding of NFAT-1 and Octamer factors enhance the activity of the Il-4 promoter , the binding of HMG I ( Y ) suppresses its activity and , therefore , appears to be involved in the suppression of Il-4 transcription in resting T lymphocytes .",gene
"Reversibility of the differentiated state in somatic cells . Analysis of de novo gene activation in multinucleated heterokaryons has shown that the differentiated state , although stable , is not irreversible , and can be reprogrammed in the presence of appropriate combinations of trans-acting regulatory molecules . These properties have been exploited to design strategies for identifying novel regulators of cellular differentiation .",gene
"Phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis activates NF-kappa B and increases human immunodeficiency virus replication in human monocytes and T lymphocytes . We have tested whether breakdown of phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) initiated by exogenous addition of a PC-specific phospholipase C ( PC-PLC ) from Bacillus cereus or by endogenous overexpression of PC-PLC induces functional activation of NF-kappa B and increases human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) enhancer activity . PC-PLC-activated hydrolysis of PC was found to induce bona fide p50/p65 NF-kappa B binding activity in three different cell lines of human or murine origin . No significant changes in the turnover of other cellular phospholipids were detected in PC-PLC-treated cells . Induction of NF-kappa B by PC-PLC did not depend on de novo synthesis of proteins or autocrine secretion of either tumor necrosis factor or interleukin 1 . In human monocytic and lymphoblastoid T-cell lines , induction of NF-kappa B by PC-PLC resulted in clear induction of luciferase expression vectors placed under the control of synthetic kappa B enhancers or wild type , but not kappa B-mutated , HIV long terminal repeat constructs . HIV replication was increased by PC-PLC in chronically infected monocytes and T lymphocytes . NF-kappa B activation promoted by addition of exogenous PC-PLC correlated with an intense production of diacylglycerol . However , addition of a phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC from B.cereus also induced diacylglycerol but did not activate kappa B enhancer-directed vectors . PC-PLC-induced NF-kappa B activation could not be blocked by a specific inhibitor of phorbol ester-inducible protein kinases C . These results indicate that a cellular transduction pathway , dependent on specific PC breakdown , is functional in T lymphocytes and monocytes and may be used by various transmembrane receptors to activate HIV transcription through NF-kappa B-dependent induction of the HIV enhancer .",gene
"Novel mechanism for inhibition of human T cells by glucocorticoids . Glucocorticoids inhibit signal transduction through IL-2 receptor . Interaction of IL-2 with its high affinity membrane receptor complex ( IL-2R ) present on activated T lymphocytes induces cell proliferation and mediates effector functions . Glucocorticoids inhibit IL-2 production by inhibiting TCR-mediated signal transduction . We asked whether they also inhibit the action of IL-2 by inhibiting signal transduction through IL-2R . Human peripheral blood T cells , stimulated with PMA for 48 h ( PMA blasts ) , were incubated with IL-2 in the presence of incremental dosages of dexamethasone ( Dex ; 10 ( -5 ) -10 ( -9 ) M ) . Dex inhibited the IL-2-dependent proliferation of PMA blasts in a dose-dependent fashion ( IC50 , 5 x 10 ( -8 ) M ) . Cell surface expression of IL-2R alpha- and beta-chains as determined by immunofluorescence analysis was not affected by Dex . In addition , Scatchard plot analysis of 125I-labeled IL-2 showed that Dex did not affect the binding of IL-2 , thus suggesting that inhibition is due to a postreceptor effect . Inhibition of T cell proliferation by Dex was associated with decreased IL-2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins and decreased phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product Rb , a protein essential for controlling the progression of cells through the cell cycle . IL-2-dependent IL-2R alpha expression in PMA blasts and NF-kB induction in resting human T cells were also inhibited by Dex . These results demonstrate that glucocorticoids inhibit preactivated T cells by down-regulating signal transduction through IL-2R .",gene
"Chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection stimulates distinct NF-kappa B/rel DNA binding activities in myelomonoblastic cells . The relationship between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection and the induction of NF-kappa B binding activity was examined in a myeloid cell model of HIV-1 infection derived from the PLB-985 cell line . Chronic infection of PLB-985 cells led to increased monocyte-specific surface marker expression , increased c-fms gene transcription , and morphological alterations consistent with differentiation along the monocytic pathway . PLB-IIIB cells displayed a constitutive NF-kappa B-like binding activity that was distinct from that induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment of the parental PLB-985 cell line . This unique DNA binding activity consisted of proteins of 70 , 90 , and 100 kDa with a high degree of binding specificity for the NF-kappa B site within the PRDII domain of beta interferon . In this report , we characterize the nature of these proteins and demonstrate that binding of these proteins is also induced following Sendai paramyxovirus infection . The 70-kDa protein corresponds to the NF-kappa B RelA ( p65 ) subunit , which is activated in response to an acute paramyxovirus infection or a chronic HIV-1 infection . Virus infection does not appear to alter the amount of RelA ( p65 ) or NFKB1 ( p50 ) but rather affects the capacity of I kappa B alpha to sequester RelA ( p65 ) , therefore leading to constitutive levels of RelA DNA binding activity and to increased levels of NF-kappa B-dependent gene activity . The virally induced 90- to 100-kDa proteins have a distinct binding specificity for the PRDII domain and an AT-rich sequence but do not cross-react with NF-kappa B subunit-specific antisera directed against NFKB1 ( p105 or p50 ) , NFKB2 ( p100 or p52 ) , RelA ( p65 ) , or c-rel . DNA binding of the 90-",gene
"to 100-kDa proteins was not inhibited by recombinant I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 and was resistant to tryptic digestion , suggesting that these proteins may not be NF-kappa B related . Transient cotransfection experiments demonstrated that RelA and NFKB1 expression maximally stimulated HIV-1 LTR- and NF-kappa B-dependent reporter genes ; differences in NF-kappa B-like binding activity were also reflected in higher constitutive levels of NF-kappa B-regulated gene expression in HIV-1-infected myeloid cells .",gene
"Presence of estrogen-binding sites on macrophage-like synoviocytes and CD8+ , CD29+ , CD45RO+ T lymphocytes in normal and rheumatoid synovium . OBJECTIVE . To study the presence of estrogen-binding sites ( EBS ) in the synovial tissues of male and female patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) and in age- and sex-matched healthy controls . METHODS . Both type 1 ( high affinity , low binding capacity ) and type 2 ( reduced affinity , higher binding capacity ) EBS were investigated in both soluble and nuclear fractions of homogenized synovial tissue samples by a dextran-coated charcoal method . To determine what type of synovial cell was positive for EBS , cryosections of synovial tissues were immunostained with a specific monoclonal anti-estrogen receptor antibody ( anti-ER MAb ) using both immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase techniques . Double immunostaining with the anti-ER MAb and with specific MAb to detect different macrophage antigens ( Ber-MAC3 , MAC387 , CD68 ) and CD8+ T cell subsets ( CD29+ , CD45RO+ and CD29- , CD45RO- ) was performed . RESULTS . Higher affinity EBS were found mostly in nuclear cell fractions of either RA or control synovial tissues ( 28 of the 33 ) . These EBS were present to a lesser extent in soluble cell fractions ( 11 of the 33 ) . Immunostaining showed the estrogen receptor-positive cells to be the macrophage-like synoviocytes and the CD8+ , CD29+ T cells both in RA and in control synovial tissues . Higher nuclear content of EBS was consistent with more intense nuclear staining of synoviocytes and T cells . CONCLUSION . It is conceivable that the immunomodulatory activity exerted by estrogens is at least partly mediated through their interaction with EBS that are present on macrophage-like synoviocytes , functioning as antigen-processing and antigen-presenting cells , and on",gene
