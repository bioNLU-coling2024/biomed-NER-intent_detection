The O

that O

plenty O
of O
medicinal O
plants O
to O
treat O
a O
wide O
spectrum O
of O
human O
ailments O
. O
Earlier O
studies O
on O
traditional O
medicinal O
plants O
also O
revealed O
that O
the O
economically O
backward O
local O
and O
tribal O
people O
of O
Tamil O

prefer O
folk O
medicine O
due O
to O
low O
cost O
and O
sometimes O
it O
is O
a O
part O
of O
their O
social O
life O
and O
culture O
[ O

] O
. O
It O
is O
evident O
from O
the O
interviews O
conducted O
in O
different O
villages O
, O
knowledge O
of O
medicinal O
plants O
is O
limited O
to O
traditional O
healers O
, O
herbalists O
and O
elderly O
persons O
who O
are O
living O
in O
rural O
areas O
. O
This O
study O
also O
points O
out O
that O
certain O
species O
of O
medicinal O
plants O
are O
being O
exploited O
by O
the O
local O

who O
are O
unaware O
of O
the O
importance O
of O
medicinal O
plants O
in O
the O
ecosystem O
. O
This O
study O
concluded O
that O
even O
though O
the O
accessibility O
of O
Western O
medicine O
for O
simple O
and O
complicated O
diseases O
is O
available O
, O
many O
people O
in O
the O
studied O
parts O
of O
Kancheepuram O
district O
is O
still O
continue O
to O
depend O
on O
medicinal O
plants O
, O
at O
least O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
some O
simple O
diseases O
such O
as O
, O
cold O
, O
cough O
, O

, O

, O

Well O
- O
knowledged O
healers O
have O
good O
interactions O
with O
patients O
and O
this O
would O
improve O
the O
quality O
of O
healthcare O
delivery O
. O
The O
present O
- O
day O
traditional O
healers O
are O
very O
old O
. O
Due O
to O
lack O
of O
interest O
among O
the O
younger O
generation O
as O
well O
as O
their O
tendency O

there O
is O
a O
possibility O
of O
losing O
this O

It O
thus O
becomes O

When O
the O

there O
exist O
various O
strategies O

classifying O

true O

false O

when O
making O
a O
ROC O

. O
These O
strategies O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
will O
make O
a O
notable O
difference O
in O
retrieval O
assessment O
. O
For O
example O
, O
in O
a O
cell B-Organism_substance
lysate I-Organism_substance
experiment O
of O
a O
certain O
organism O
, O
it O
is O
customary O
to O
estimate O
the O
number O
of O
false O
positive O
hits O
by O
introducing O
a O
decoy O
database O
during O
the O
data O
analysis O
. O
The O
main O
idea O
there O
is O
to O
first O
sort O
the O
peptide O
hits O
according O
to O
their O
scores O
. O
Then O
for O
each O
decoy O
hit O
, O
one O
assumes O
that O
there O
is O
just O
one O
corresponding O
false O
hit O
in O
the O
target O
database O
. O
This O
strategy O
has O
been O
used O
extensively O
[ O
24 O
] O
. O
ROC O
analyses O
done O
this O
way O
generally O
count O
false O

, O
which O
are O
highly O
homologous O
to O
the O
target O
peptides O
, O
towards O
true O
positives O
. O
This O
has O
two O
effects O
: O
an O
overcount O
of O
true O
positives O
and O
a O
undercount O
of O
false O
positives O
. O
As O
a O
consequence O
, O
the O
ROC O
curves O
will O
appear O
more O
impressive O
. O
To O
mimick O
this O
situation O
, O
we O
used O
BLAST O
to O
find O
in O
the O
NCBI O

s O
nr O
database O
highly O
homologous O
proteins O

the O
target O
proteins O
used O
in O
the O
experiment O
and O
include O
those O
proteins O
in O
our O
true O
positive O
set O
. O
This O
strategy O
produces O
ROC O
curves O
shown O
as O
the O
solid O
curves O
of O
Figure O
S8 O
. O
When O
compared O
to O
Figure O
6 O
and O
Figure O
S6 O
, O
the O
ROC O
curves O
produced O
by O
this O
strategy O
seem O
much O
more O
impressive O
. O
Not O
counting O
highly O
homologous O
proteins O
as O
false O
positives O
would O
probably O
be O
agreeable O
. O
However O
, O
counting O
those O
peptides O
/ O
proteins O
as O
true O
positives O
could O
be O
exaggerating O
. O
Therefore O
one O
may O
use O
a O
slightly O
different O
strategy O
: O
removing O
from O
consideration O
proteins O
homologous O
to O
the O
target O
proteins O
, O
which O
is O
called O
the O
cluster O
removal O
strategy O
[ O
11 O
] O
. O
The O
dashed O
curves O
of O
Figure O
S9 O
are O
ROC O
curves O
obtained O
this O
way O
. O
This O
strategy O
also O
produces O
slightly O
more O
impressive O
ROC O
curves O
than O
in O
Figure O
6 O
and O
Figure O
S6 O
. O
Apparently O
, O
this O
indicates O
the O
highly O
homologous O
false O
positive O
hits O
are O
the O
ones O
that O
degrade O
the O

Thus O
, O
it O
can O
be O
useful O
to O
remove O

false O

consideration O
. O
Keeping O
only O
the O

Family O
interactions O
that O
are O
characterized O
by O
conflict O
and O

to O
disrupt O

Moreover O
, O
these O
findings O
seem O
to O
be O
moderated O
by O
child O
age O
in O
that O
poorer O
adherence O
often O
occurs O
when O

Although O

Because O

This O

Thus O

occur O

Conclusion O
RLs O
are O
new O
actors O
in O
animal O
and O
plant O
defense O
and O
their O
low O
toxicity O
and O
biodegradability O
make O
them O
promising O
molecules O
to O
be O
used O
against O
pathogens O
. O
In O
this O
respect O
, O
there O
are O
some O
clues O
now O
available O
for O
the O
success O
of O
RL O
applications O
in O

A O
better O
understanding O

action O
, O
especially O
their O
perception O
and O
the O

activated O
, O
will O
be O
very O
important O
to O
potentiate O
their O
beneficial O
effects O
in O
plants O
. O
RLs O
have O
a O
dual O
mode O
of O
action O
: O
they O
are O
antimicrobial O
and O
also O
stimulate O
plant O
defense O
responses O
. O
This O
dual O
property O
is O
probably O
very O
important O
for O
the O
efficiency O
of O
new O
biopesticides O
. O
In O
animals O
, O
the O
use O
of O
RLs O
is O
also O
at O
an O
advanced O
stage O
. O
RLs O
are O
successfully O
used O
as O
antimicrobial O
agents O
, O
especially O
for O
skin B-Organ
disease O

. O
Deep O
insight O
into O
the O
physiochemical O
effects O
of O
RLs O
and O
their O
biological O
importance O
would O
reveal O
new O
dimensions O
in O
the O
fields O
of O
research O
like O

, O
precisely O
in O

BACKGROUND O
: O
We O
suggest O
that O
surgical O
extirpation O
of O
primary B-Cancer
breast I-Cancer
cancer I-Cancer
among O
other O
effects O
accelerates O
relapse O

. O
These O
accelerated O
relapses O
occur O
within O
10 O
months O
of O
surgery O
for O
untreated O
patients O
. O
The O
mechanism O
proposed O
is O
a O
stimulation O
of O
angiogenesis O
for O
distant B-Cancer
dormant I-Cancer
micrometastases I-Cancer
. O
This O
has O
been O
suggested O
as O
one O
of O
the O
mechanisms O

explain O
the O

for O
women O
aged O
40 O

49 O

We O
could O
imagine O
that O
it O
also O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
adjuvant O
chemotherapy O
effectiveness O
since O
, O
perhaps O
not O

, O

HYPOTHESIS O
: O
We O
speculate O
that O
there O

a O
burst O

We O
also O
speculate O
that O
this O
synchronizes O
them O
into O
a O
temporal O
highly O
chemosensitive O
state O
and O
is O
the O
underlying O
reason O
why O
adjuvant O

works O
particularly O
well O
for O
that O
patient O

Furthermore O
, O

Many O

the O

Cancer B-Cell

Recent O
